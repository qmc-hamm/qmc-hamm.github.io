We show that the relativistic Bose gas at finite chemical potential has a sign and ``silver blaze'' problem, similar to QCD. We then apply stochastic quantization and complex Langevin dynamics to study this theory with nonperturbative lattice simulations. Independence of chemical potential at small and a transition to a condensed phase at large chemical potential are found. Lattices of size N4, with N=4, 6, 8, 10, are used. We show that the sign problem is severe, however, we find that it has no negative effect using this approach. This improves the prospects of applying stochastic quantization to QCD at nonzero density.},

  abstract = {The electronic properties of graphene can be manipulated via mechanical deformations, which opens prospects for both studying the Dirac fermions in new regimes and for new device applications. Certain natural configurations of strain generate large nearly uniform pseudomagnetic fields, which have opposite signs in the two valleys, and give rise to flat spin- and valley-degenerate pseudo-Landau levels (PLLs). Here we consider the effect of the Coulomb interactions in strained graphene with a uniform pseudomagnetic field. We show that the spin or valley degeneracies of the PLLs get lifted by the interactions, giving rise to topological insulator states. In particular, when a nonzero PLL is quarter or three-quarter filled, an anomalous quantum Hall state spontaneously breaking time-reversal symmetry emerges. At half-filled PLLs, a weak spin-orbital interaction stabilizes the time-reversal-symmetric quantum spin-Hall state. These many-body states are characterized by the quantized conductance and persist to a high temperature scale set by the Coulomb interactions, which we estimate to be a few hundreds Kelvin at moderate strain values. At fractional fillings, fractional quantum Hall states breaking valley symmetry emerge. These results suggest a new route to realizing robust topological states in mesoscopic graphene.},

Despite the intriguing scaling of the normalization of these two excess rates with approximately the square of the mass number \$A\^2\$, we argue that the possibility of common origin by dark matter scattering via nuclear recoils is strongly disfavored, even allowing for exotic condensed matter effects in an as-yet unmeasured kinematic regime. We also investigate the possibility of inelastic nuclear scattering by cosmic ray neutrons, solar neutrinos, and photons as the origin, and quantitatively disfavor all three based on known fluxes of particles.},

  abstract = {Competition between magnetism and the kinetic energy of mobile carriers (typically holes) in doped antiferromagnets may lead to 'stripe' phases, which are charged rivers separating regions of oppositely phased antiferromagnetism. In copper oxides the main experimental evidence for such coexisting static spin and charge order comes from neutron scattering in La1.48Nd0.4Sr0.12CuO4 (LNSCO; ref. 5) and La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 (LBCO; ref. 6). However, as a neutron is neutral, it does not detect charge but rather its associated lattice distortion, so it is not known whether the stripes involve ordering of the doped holes. Here we present a study of the charge order in LBCO with resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSXS). We observe giant resonances near the Fermi level as well as near the correlated gap, demonstrating significant modulation in both the doped-hole density and the 'Mottness', or the degree to which the system resembles a Mott insulator. The peak-to-trough amplitude of the valence modulation is estimated to be 0.063 holes, which suggests an integrated area of 0.59 holes under a single stripe, close to the expected 0.5 for half-filled stripes.},

The coupling of the fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom leads to a self-consistent relation for the effective mass, which has a strong coupling solution in addition to the well-known weak-coupling spin-density-wave solution. We use the recently introduced concept of critical quasiparticles, employing a scale-dependent effective mass ratio m{${_\ast}$}/m and quasiparticle weight factor Z. We adopt a scale-dependent vertex correction that boosts the coupling of fermions and spin fluctuations. The ensuing spin fluctuation spectrum obeys {$\omega$}/T scaling. Our results are in good agreement with experimental data on the heavy-fermion compounds YbRh2Si2 and CeCu6-xAux for 3D and 2D spin fluctuations, respectively.},

Here, we show that the metal\textendash insulator transition temperature of thin VO2(001) films can be changed continuously from \textasciitilde 285 to \textasciitilde 345 K by varying the thickness of the RuO2 buffer layer (resulting in different epitaxial strains). Using strain-, polarization- and temperature-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in combination with X-ray diffraction and electronic transport measurements, we demonstrate that the transition temperature and the structural distortion across the transition depend on the orbital occupancy in the metallic state. Our findings open up the possibility of controlling the conductivity in atomically thin VO2 layers by manipulating the orbital occupancy by, for example, heterostructural engineering.},

  abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) studies of weakly interacting complexes have recently focused on the importance of van der Waals dispersion forces, whereas the role of exchange has received far less attention. Here, by exploiting the subtle binding between water and a boron and nitrogen doped benzene derivative (1,2-azaborine) we show how exact exchange can alter the binding conformation within a complex. Benchmark values have been calculated for three orientations of the water monomer on 1,2-azaborine from explicitly correlated quantum chemical methods, and we have also used diffusion quantum Monte Carlo. For a host of popular DFT exchange-correlation functionals we show that the lack of exact exchange leads to the wrong lowest energy orientation of water on 1,2-azaborine. As such, we suggest that a high proportion of exact exchange and the associated improvement in the electronic structure could be needed for the accurate prediction of physisorption sites on doped surfaces and in complex organic molecules. Meanwhile to predict correct absolute interaction energies an accurate description of exchange needs to be augmented by dispersion inclusive functionals, and certain non-local van der Waals functionals (optB88- and optB86b-vdW) perform very well for absolute interaction energies. Through a comparison with water on benzene and borazine (B3N3H6) we show that these results could have implications for the interaction of water with doped graphene surfaces, and suggest a possible way of tuning the interaction energy.},

  abstract = {Calculations of the binding energy of the transition-metal oxide molecules TiO and MnO are presented, using a recently developed phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo approach. This method maps the interacting many-body problem onto a linear combination of noninteracting problems by a complex Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, and controls the phase and sign problem with a phaseless approximation relying on a trial wave function. It employs random walks in Slater determinant space to project the ground state of the system, and allows use of much of the same machinery as in standard density functional theory calculations using the plane-wave basis and nonlocal pseudopotentials. The calculations used a single Slater determinant trial wave function obtained from a density functional calculation, with no further optimization. The calculated binding energies are in good agreement with experiment and with recent diffusion Monte Carlo results. Together with previous results for sp-bonded systems, the present study indicates that the phaseless auxiliary-field method is a robust and promising approach for the study of correlation effects in real materials.},

A freezing scenario, which has not been observed previously, is reported; while the pore surface induces orientational order of water in contact with it, water does not crystallize at temperatures as low as 173 K. Crystallization at the surface is suppressed as the number of hydrogen bonds formed is insufficient (even when including hydrogen bonds with the surface), while crystallization in the pore center is hindered as the curvature prevents the formation of a network of tetrahedrally coordinated molecules. This sheds light on the concept of an ubiquitous unfreezable water layer by showing that the latter has a rigid (i.e., glassy) liquidlike structure, but can exhibit orientational order.},

The approximations studied are based on the widely used PBE and BLYP exchange-correlation functionals, and we characterize their errors before and after correction for 1- and 2-body errors, the corrections being performed using the methods of Gaussian approximation potentials. The errors of the uncorrected and corrected approximations are investigated for two related types of water system: first, the compressed liquid at temperature 420 K and density 1.245 g/cm3 where the experimental pressure is 15 kilobars; second, thermal samples of compressed water clusters from the trimer to the 27-mer. For the liquid, we report four first-principles molecular dynamics simulations, two generated with the uncorrected PBE and BLYP approximations and a further two with their 1- and 2-body corrected counterparts. The errors of the simulations are characterized by comparing with experimental data for the pressure, with neutron-diffraction data for the three radial distribution functions, and with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) benchmarks for the energies of sets of configurations of the liquid in periodic boundary conditions. The DFT errors of the configuration samples of compressed water clusters are computed using QMC benchmarks. We find that the 2-body and beyond-2-body errors in the liquid are closely related to similar errors exhibited by the clusters. For both the liquid and the clusters, beyond-2-body errors of DFT make a substantial contribution to the overall errors, so that correction for 1- and 2-body errors does not suffice to give a satisfactory description. For BLYP, a recent representation of 3-body energies due to Medders, Babin, and Paesani [J. Chem. Theory Comput.9, 1103 (2013)] gives a reasonably good way of correcting for beyond-2-body errors, after which the remaining errors are typically 0.5 mE h {$\simeq$} 15 meV/monomer for the liquid and the clusters.},

In order to investigate system-size errors, we also report DFT calculations of ES on repeating cells of up to {$\sim$}1000 atoms, which indicate that QMC calculations on systems of only 54 atoms should yield high precision. The DFT calculations also provide the relaxed structures used in the variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations.

  abstract = {Calculations of formation energies and charge transition levels of defects routinely rely on density functional theory (DFT) for describing the electronic structure. Since bulk band gaps of semiconductors and insulators are not well described in semilocal approximations to DFT, band-gap correction schemes or advanced theoretical models, which properly describe band gaps, need to be employed. However, it has become apparent that different methods that reproduce the experimental band gap can yield substantially different results regarding charge transition levels of point defects. We investigate this problem in the case of the (+2/0) charge transition level of the O vacancy in ZnO, which has attracted considerable attention as a benchmark case. For this purpose, we first perform calculations based on nonscreened hybrid density functionals, and then compare our results with those of other methods. While our results agree very well with those obtained with screened hybrid functionals, they are strikingly different compared to those obtained with other band-gap-corrected schemes. Nevertheless, we show that all the different methods agree well with each other and with our calculations when a suitable alignment procedure is adopted. The proposed procedure consists in aligning the electron band structure through an external potential, such as the vacuum level. When the electron densities are well reproduced, this procedure is equivalent to an alignment through the average electrostatic potential in a calculation subject to periodic boundary conditions. We stress that, in order to give accurate defect levels, a theoretical scheme is required to yield not only band gaps in agreement with experiment, but also band edges correctly positioned with respect to such a reference potential.},

However various experimental evidences taken for compounds with distinct alkali content established the interplay of strong correlations and Jahn Teller distortions of the C60 ball. The importance of electronic correlations even in A3C60 has been highlighted by the recent discovery of two expanded fulleride Cs3C60 isomeric phases that are Mott insulators at ambient pressure. Both phases undergo a pressure induced first order Mott transition to SC with a (p, T) phase diagram displaying a dome shaped SC, a common situation encountered nowadays in correlated electron systems. NMR experiments allowed us to establish that the bipartite A15 phase displays N\'eel order at 47K, while magnetic freezing only occurs at lower temperature in the fcc phase. NMR data do permit us to conclude that well above the critical pressure, the singlet superconductivity found for light alkalis is recovered. However deviations from BCS expectations linked with electronic correlations are found near the Mott transition. So, although SC involves an electron-phonon mechanism, correlations have a significant incidence on the electronic properties, as had been anticipated from DMFT calculations.},

In the insulating (semiconducting) regime, below TMI, the perovskites are monoclinic, space group P21/n, and contain two chemically different Ni1 and Ni2 cations, as a result of the charge disproportionation (CHD) of Ni3+ cations. Above TMI the samples become orthorhombic, space group Pbnm. Upon heating across TMI, the CHD vanishes and there is an abrupt convergence of the two sets (Ni1 and Ni2) of three Ni-O bond lengths, in the monoclinic-insulating phase, to three unique Ni-O distances in the orthorhombic-metallic phase. An unexpected expansion of the b unit-cell parameter is observed across the electronic transition. This effect, not reported for the former members of the series, is the consequence of an extremely anisotropic rearrangement of Ni-O bonds across the transition. The distortion of the NiO6 octahedra reaches its maximum value at temperatures close to TMI. The evolution of the mean {$\langle$}Ni-O{$\rangle$} bond lengths suggests a gradual increase of the degree of CHD (i.e., the difference between the average size of Ni1O6 and Ni2O6 octahedra) on increasing temperature in the insulating regime, to reach a maximum at 60\textendash 80 K below the MI transition.},

Following some of the ideas presented therein, and applied to a Hamiltonian containing a Rashba-like interaction, a general variational Monte Carlo approach is here introduced that treats in an efficient and very accurate way the spin degrees of freedom in atoms when spin-orbit effects are included in the Hamiltonian describing the electronic structure. We illustrate the algorithm on the evaluation of the spin-orbit splittings of isolated C, Tl, Pb, Bi, and Po atoms. In the case of the carbon atom, we investigate the differences between the inclusion of the spin orbit in its realistic and effective spherically symmetrized forms. The method exhibits a very good accuracy in describing the small energy splittings, opening the way for systematic quantum Monte Carlo studies of spin-orbit effects in atomic systems.},

We discuss the zero and finite temperature properties of entanglement in interacting spin, fermionic and bosonic model systems. Both bipartite and multipartite entanglement will be considered. At equilibrium we emphasize on how entanglement is connected to the phase diagram of the underlying model. The behavior of entanglement can be related, via certain witnesses, to thermodynamic quantities thus offering interesting possibilities for an experimental test. Out of equilibrium we discuss how to generate and manipulate entangled states by means of many-body Hamiltonians.},

Extreme sensitivity of {$\mathsl{T}\mathsl{N}$} to small changes in the amount of oxygen in the sample is the major problem. This problem is solved here by using the novel compound (Ca0.1La0.9)(Ba1.65La0.35)Cu3O{$\mathsl{y}$} for which there is a region where {$\mathsl{T}\mathsl{N}$} is independent of oxygen doping. Meticulous measurements of {$\mathsl{T}\mathsl{N}$} for samples with 16O and 18O find the absence of an oxygen isotope effect on {$\mathsl{T}\mathsl{N}$} with unprecedented accuracy. A possible interpretation of our finding and existing data is that isotope substitution affects the normal state charge carrier density.},

  abstract = {The crystallographic and physical properties of polycrystalline and single-crystal samples of BaCo2As2 and K-doped Ba1-xKxCo2As2 (x=0.06,0.22) are investigated by x-ray and neutron powder diffraction, magnetic susceptibility {$\chi$}, magnetization, heat capacity Cp,As75 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and electrical resistivity {$\rho$} measurements versus temperature T. The crystals were grown using both Sn flux and CoAs self-flux, where the Sn-grown crystals contain 1.6\textendash 2.0 mol\% Sn. All samples crystallize in the tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure (space group I4/mmm). For BaCo2As2, powder neutron diffraction data show that the c-axis lattice parameter exhibits anomalous negative thermal expansion from 10 K to 300 K, whereas the a axis lattice parameter and the unit cell volume show normal positive thermal expansion over this T range. No transitions in BaCo2As2 were found in this T range from any of the measurements. Below 40\textendash 50 K, we find {$\rho\propto$}T2, indicating a Fermi liquid ground state. A large density of states at the Fermi energy {$\mathscr{D}$}(EF){$\approx$}18 states/(eV f.u.) for both spin directions is found from low-T Cp(T) measurements, whereas the band-structure calculations give {$\mathscr{D}$}(EF)=8.23 states/(eV f.u.). The enhancement of the former value above the latter is inferred to arise from electron-electron correlations and the electron-phonon interaction. The derived intrinsic {$\chi$}(T) monotonically increases with decreasing T, with anisotropy {$\chi$}ab{$>\chi$}c. The 75As-NMR shift data versus T have the same T dependence as the derived {$\chi$}(T) data, demonstrating that the derived {$\chi$}(T) data are intrinsic. The observed 75As nuclear spin dynamics rule out the presence of N\'eel-type antiferromagnetic electronic spin fluctuations, but are consistent with the presence of ferromagnetic and/or stripe-type antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. The crystals of Ba0.78K0.22Co2As2 were grown in Sn flux and show properties very similar to those of undoped BaCo2As2. On the other hand, the crystals from two batches of Ba0.94K0.06Co2As2 grown in CoAs self-flux show evidence of weak ferromagnetism at T{$\lessequivlnt$}10 K with small ordered moments at 1.8 K of {$\approx$}0.007 and 0.03{$\mu$}B per formula unit, respectively.},

This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

Our energy functional is that of the local-density approximation plus the mean-field approximation to the remaining part of the U term. We argue that such a method should make sense, if one accepts the Hubbard model and the success of constrained-local-density-approximation parameter calculations. Using this ab initio scheme, we find that all late-3d-transition-metal monoxides, as well as the parent compounds of the high-Tc compounds, are large-gap magnetic insulators of the charge-transfer type. Further, the method predicts that LiNiO2 is a low-spin ferromagnet and NiS a local-moment p-type metal. The present version of the scheme fails for the early-3d-transition-metal monoxides and for the late 3d transition metals.},

  abstract = {With the objective of analyzing which kind of reference data is appropriate for benchmarking quantum chemical approaches for transition metal compounds, we present the following, (a) a collection of 60 transition metal diatomic molecules for which experimentally derived dissociation energies, equilibrium distances, and harmonic vibrational frequencies are known and (b) a composite computational approach based on coupled-cluster theory with basis set extrapolation, inclusion of core\textendash valence correlation, and corrections for relativistic and multireference effects. The latter correction was obtained from internally contracted multireference coupled-cluster (icMRCC) theory. This composite approach has been used to obtain the dissociation energies and spectroscopic constants for the 60 molecules in our data set. In accordance with previous studies on a subset of molecules, we find that multireference corrections are rather small in many cases and CCSD(T) can provide accurate reference values, if the complete basis set limit is explored. In addition, the multireference correction improves the results in cases where CCSD(T) is not a good approximation. For a few cases, however, strong deviations from experiment persist, which cannot be explained by the remaining error in the computational approach. We suggest that these experimentally derived values require careful revision. This also shows that reliable reference values for benchmarking approximate computational methods are not always easily accessible via experiment and accurate computations may provide an alternative way to access them. In order to assess how the choice of reference data affects benchmark studies, we tested 10 DFT functionals for the molecules in the present data set against experimental and calculated reference values. Despite the differences between these two sets of reference values, we found that the ranking of the relative performance of the DFT functionals is nearly independent of the chosen reference.},

This information is synthesized into a consistent view on a number of topics important to both this material class and the overall cuprate phenomenology including the phase diagram, the superconducting order-parameter symmetry, electron-phonon coupling, phase separation, the nature of the normal state, the role of competing orders, the spin-density wave mean-field description of the normal state, and pseudogap effects.},

We have also made comparison with the constrained local density approximation (LDA) method and found some discrepancies in a number of cases. We emphasize that our scheme and the constrained local density approximation LDA method theoretically ought to give similar results and the discrepancies may be attributed to technical difficulties in performing calculations based on currently implemented constrained LDA schemes.},

Our results show that the charge state is a degree of freedom that can be used to control the interaction of defects with strain and hence the concentration and location of defects in epitaxial films.

This approach, however, computes the square of the local order parameter, and so when it is small, very large system sizes at high precisions are required to obtain reliable results. Alternatively, one can pin the order by introducing a local symmetry-breaking field and then measure the induced local order parameter infinitely far from the pinning center. The method is tested here at length for the Hubbard model on honeycomb lattice, within the realm of the projective auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. With our enhanced resolution, we find a direct and continuous quantum phase transition between the semimetallic and the insulating antiferromagnetic states with increase of the interaction. The single-particle gap, measured in units of Hubbard U, tracks the staggered magnetization. An excellent data collapse is obtained by finite-size scaling, with the values of the critical exponents in accord with the Gross-Neveu universality class of the transition.},

The basic idea consists in replacing the usual ``bare'' estimator associated with the observable by an improved or ``renormalized'' estimator. Using this estimator more accurate averages are obtained: Not only the statistical fluctuations are reduced but also the systematic error (bias) associated with the approximate VMC or (fixed-node) DMC probability densities. It is shown that improved estimators obey a zero-variance zero-bias property similar to the usual zero-variance zero-bias property of the energy with the local energy as improved estimator. Using this property improved estimators can be optimized and the resulting accuracy on expectation values may reach the remarkable accuracy obtained for total energies. As an important example, we present the application of our formalism to the computation of forces in molecular systems. Calculations of the entire force curve of the H2,LiH, and Li2 molecules are presented. Spectroscopic constants Re (equilibrium distance) and {$\omega$}e (harmonic frequency) are also computed. The equilibrium distances are obtained with a relative error smaller than 1\%, while the harmonic frequencies are computed with an error of about 10\%. \textcopyright{} 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

We observe the onset of a spurious dose-dependent prominent peak at an energy range where the lower Hubbard band has been previously reported in this compound, raising questions on its previous interpretation. By a careful analysis of the dose-dependent effects we succeed in disentangling the contributions coming from the oxygen vacancy states and from the lower Hubbard band. We obtain the ARPES spectrum in the limit of a negligible concentration of vacancies, where a clear signal of a lower Hubbard band remains. We support our study by means of state-of-the-art ab initio calculations that include correlation effects and the presence of oxygen vacancies. Our results underscore the relevance of potential spurious states affecting ARPES experiments in correlated metals, which are associated with the ubiquitous oxygen vacancies as extensively reported in the context of a two-dimensional electron gas at the surface of insulating d0 transition metal oxides.},

We present a new expression for the force in pure-estimator diffusion Monte Carlo that satisfies the ZV principle and can be evaluated much more efficiently than previous expressions while maintaining comparable accuracy. This expression is the sum of a pure expectation value and a variational expectation value, which separately satisfy the ZV principle. The bias in this force estimator is second order in the deviation of the trial wave function from the diffusion Monte Carlo wave function. Results for small molecules demonstrate the accuracy of the method and its statistical efficiency.},

Such interactions could lead to a quantum spin-liquid (QSL) ground state at zero temperature. Recent theoretical studies suggest two potential signatures of a QSL at finite temperatures, namely, a scaling behavior of thermodynamic quantities in the presence of quenched disorder, and a two-step release of the magnetic entropy. Here, we present both signatures in Ag3LiIr2O6 which is synthesized from {$\alpha-$}Li2IrO3 by replacing the interlayer Li atoms with Ag atoms. In addition, the dc susceptibility data confirm the absence of a long-range order, and the ac susceptibility data rule out a spin-glass transition. These observations suggest a closer proximity to the QSL in Ag3LiIr2O6 compared to its parent compound {$\alpha-$}Li2IrO3 that orders at 15 K. We discuss an enhanced spin-orbit coupling due to a mixing between silver d and oxygen p orbitals as a potential underlying mechanism.},

Lett. 96 130201 (2006)], we explore the possibilities of expanding the wavefunction in linear combinations of pfaffians. We observe that molecular systems require much larger expansions than atomic systems and linear combinations of a few pfaffians lead to rather small gains in correlation energy. We also test the wavefunction based on fully antisymmetrized product of independent pair orbitals. Despite its seemingly large variational potential, we do not observe additional gains in correlation energy. We find that pfaffians lead to substantial improvements in fermion nodes when compared to Hartree-Fock wavefunctions and exhibit the minimal number of two nodal domains in agreement with recent results on fermion nodes topology. We analyze the nodal structure differences of Hartree-Fock, pfaffian, and essentially exact large-scale configuration interaction wavefunctions.

Density-functional calculations using common functionals such a local density approximation and B3LYP differ substantially from the QMC binding curve. We show that use of full Hartree-Fock exchange and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) correlation (HFX+PBEC) obtains close agreement with the QMC results, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

The hydrogen desorption temperatures and activation energies decreased from 186 \textdegree C and 116 kJ{$\cdot$}mol-1 for the largest particles to 70 \textdegree C and 58 kJ{$\cdot$}mol-1 for the smallest particles. In addition, decreasing particle sizes lowered the pressures needed for reloading. This reported size-performance correlation for NaAlH4 may guide hydrogen storage research for a wide range of nanostructured light (metal) hydrides.},

Specifically, we ask whether the ground-state energy density of a Hamiltonian whose ground state is in phase A can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a wave function, which represents a different phase B. We show this is indeed the case when A has discrete symmetry breaking order in one dimension or topological order in two dimensions, while B is disordered. We argue that, if reasonable conditions of physicality are imposed upon the trial wave function, then this is not possible when A has discrete symmetry breaking in dimensions greater than one and B is symmetric. Some other situations are also discussed.},

Low-density flat-band systems play a vital role because the energy range of the band is so narrow that the Coulomb interactions dominate over kinetic energy, putting these materials in the strongly-correlated regime. Experimentally, when a band is narrow in both energy and momentum, its filling may be tuned in situ across the whole range, from empty to full. Recently, one particular flat-band system\textemdash that of van der Waals heterostructures, such as twisted bilayer graphene\textemdash has exhibited strongly correlated states and superconductivity, but it is still not clear to what extent the two are linked. Here, we review the status and prospects for flat-band engineering in van der Waals heterostructures and explore how both phenomena emerge from the moir\'e flat bands.},

Testing advocates have suggested that more frequent classroom testing stimulates practice and review, gives students more opportunities for feedback on their work, and has a positive influence on student study time. Reviewers of relevant research and evaluation literature, however, have expressed uncertainty about whether such benefits are actually realized in classrooms. The present review distinguishes research on frequent classroom testing from research in two related areas, research on adjunct questions and research on mastery testing, and provides results from a meta-analysis of findings on frequency of classroom testing. The meta-analysis showed that students who took at least one test during a 15-week term scored about one half of a standard deviation higher on criterion examinations than did students who took no tests. Better criterion performance was associated with more frequent testing, but the amount of improvement in achievement diminished as the number of tests increased.},

Our tutorial is interactive, in that it uses a hands-on physical model designed to engage students and allow them to experience various aspects of the concepts being addressed. Students used our tutorial just after completion of a standard semester's coverage of the First Law material. After the tutorial, we measure a normalized gain of 0.70 for students' understanding of internal energy changes associated with changes in heat and/or work. In addition, the percentage of students' possessing a robust understanding of thermal energy exchange (heat) is shown to increase from 69\%, after course instruction, to 100\% on measures after tutorial use. We also report comparisons between test and control groups on common exam questions pertaining to the First Law of Thermodynamics. Our results show that the two groups performed the same on a standard calculation problem, but the test group who used the tutorial scored substantially higher on the conceptual problem, showing a stronger conceptual understanding of the First Law. This work shows that the learning associated with a single in-class tutorial greatly outweighs any learning that has taken place over a semesters worth of lecture and homework on the given topic.},

In metadynamics, sampling is accelerated by a history-dependent bias potential, which is adaptively constructed in the space of the CVs. Since its first appearance, significant improvements have been made to the original algorithm, leading to an efficient, flexible, and accurate method that has found many successful applications in several domains of science. Here, we discuss first the theory underlying metadynamics and its recent developments. In particular, we focus on the crucial issue of choosing an appropriate set of CVs and on the possible strategies to alleviate this difficulty. Later in the second part, we present a few recent representative applications, which we have classified into three main classes: solid-state physics, chemical reactions, and biomolecules. \textcopyright{} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

We show for both the 2:1:4 and 1:2:3 systems that bulk properties, such as the spin susceptibiltiy, and probes at the antiferromagnetic wave vector ({$\pi$},{$\pi$}), such as 63T1, the Cu63 spin-lattice relaxation time, both display a crossover at a temperature Tcr, which increases linearly with decreasing hole concentration, from a nonuniversal regime to a z=1 scaling regime characterized by spin pseudogap behavior. We pursue the consequences of the ansatz that Tcr corresponds to a fixed value of the antiferromagnetic correlation length {$\xi$} and show how this enables one to extract the magnitude and temperature dependence of {$\xi$} from measurements of T1 alone. We show that like Tcr, the temperature T* which marks a crossover at low temperatures from the z=1 scaling regime to a quantum disordered regime, exhibits the same dependence on doping for the 2:1:4 and 1:2:3 systems, and so arrive at a unified description of magnetic behavior in the cuprates, in which the determining factor is the planar hole concentration.},

We use this mapping to extract the doping dependence of the strength, f(x) of the spin liquid component and the effective interaction, J eff(x) between the remnant localized spins that compose it; we find that both decrease linearly with x as the doping level increases. We discuss the physical origin of pseudogap behaviour and conclude that it is consistent with scenarios in which the both the large energy gaps found in the normal state and their subsequent superconductivity are brought about by the coupling between the Fermi liquid quasiparticles and the spin liquid excitations, and that differences in this coupling between the 1\textendash 2\textendash 3 and 2\textendash 1\textendash 4 materials can explain the measured differences in their superconducting transition temperatures and other properties.},

The results were analyzed by SPSS and Meta Win. 233 effect sizes were calculated from 78 studies. Studies with similar exam frequency were categorized into three categories: low, medium, and high according to the frequency of the tests used in the study. According to the results, the cumulative mean effect size for 78 studies was .46. The results also indicated that there were not statistically significant differences between the mean effect sizes of the studies examine students at high, medium and low frequency levels. Overall, the findings indicated that frequent testing increases academic achievement. Also, the effectiveness of a set of categorical variables possibly related to the overall effect size for academic achievement is sought through Q statistic.},

  abstract = {SummaryThe first transition row oxides and sulfides are studied using several different levels of theory. The calculations show the bonding mechanism in the sulfides and oxides to be very similar. For the oxides, accurate experimental data allow the theoretical methods to be calibrated. The same level of theory is used to study the sulfides where there is far less experimental information. For ScO through MnO and CuO the coupled cluster singles and doubles technique including a perturbational estimate of the connected triple excitations [CCSD(T)] yields spectroscopic constants ({$\gamma$}e, {$\omega$}e, andD0) in good agreement with experiment. The triple excitations are found to be very important in achieving this accuracy. For FeO to NiO, the self-consistent-field (SCF) approach yields {$\pi$} orbitals that are localized on the metal or oxygen. This appears to cause problems for the single reference techniques; this is discussed in detail for NiO. The complete-active-space SCF/internally contracted averaged coupled pair functional approach (CASSCF/ICACPF) works well for FeO to NiO. The calculation of accurate dipole moments is found to be very difficult.},

Whereas the insignificant modification of the temperature dependence of the superfluid density in Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 and Ba(Fe1-xNix)2As2 points to important native disorder present before the irradiation, the critical temperatures of these materials undergo a suppression equivalent to that observed in the much cleaner BaFe2(As1-xPx)2.

Electron doping is simulated by two different approaches and the resulting changes in the local charge distribution are studied in detail and compared to the corresponding changes in hole-doped La2CuO4. The electric field gradient (EFG) at the copper nucleus is investigated and good agreement is found with experimental values. In particular a careful study of the various contributions to the EFG exhibits that the drastic reduction of the main component of the EFG in the electron-doped material with respect to La2CuO4 is due to a reduction of the occupancy of the 3d3z2-r2 atomic orbital. Furthermore, the chemical shieldings at the copper nucleus are determined and are compared to results obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The magnetic hyperfine coupling constants are derived from the spin density distribution calculated for different spin multiplicities.},

Measurements of transport, magnetization, and polarized neutron reflectivity reveal that the ferromagnetism is relatively uniform in the metallic state, and is strongly modulated in the insulating state, being high in LaMnO3 and suppressed in SrMnO3. The modulation is consistent with a Mott transition driven by the proximity between the (LaMnO3)/(SrMnO3) interfaces. The insulating state for n{$\geq$}3 obeys variable range hopping at low temperatures. We suggest that this is due to states at the Fermi level that emerge at the (LaMnO3)/(SrMnO3) interfaces and are localized by disorder.},

  abstract = {We report on the electronic structure of the perovskite oxide CaCrO3 using valence-band, core-level, and Cr 2p-3d resonant photoemission spectroscopy (PES). Despite its antiferromagnetic order, a clear Fermi edge characteristic of a metal with dominant Cr 3d character is observed in the valence-band spectrum. The Cr 3d single-particle density of states are spread over 2 eV, with the photoemission spectral weight distributed in two peaks centered at \textasciitilde 1.2 and 0.2 eV below EF, suggestive of the coherent and incoherent states resulting from strong electron-electron correlations. Resonant PES across the Cr 2p-3d threshold identifies a ``two-hole'' correlation satellite and yields an on-site Coulomb energy U\textasciitilde{} 4.8 eV. The metallic DOS at EF is also reflected through the presence of a well-screened feature at the low binding energy side of the Cr 2p core-level spectrum. X-ray-absorption spectroscopy at Cr L3,2 and O K edges exhibit small temperature-dependent changes that point toward a small change in Cr-O hybridization. The Cr 2p core-level spectrum can be reproduced using cluster model calculations that include a charge transfer from the metallic screening channel at EF. The overall results indicate that CaCrO3 is a strongly hybridized antiferromagnetic metal, lying in the regime intermediate to Mott-Hubbard and charge-transfer systems.},

  abstract = {A characteristic feature of a superconductor made of multiple condensates is the possibility of the shape resonances in superconducting gaps. Shape resonances belong to class of Fano resonances in configuration interaction between open and closed scattering channels. The Shape resonances arise because of the exchange interaction, a Josephson-like term, for transfer of pairs between different condensates in different Fermi surface spots in the special cases where at least one Fermi surface is near a 2.5 Lifshitz topological transition. We show that tuning the shape resonances show first, the gap suppression (like a Fano anti-resonance) driven by configuration interaction between a BCS condensate and a BEC-like condensate, and second, the gap amplification (like a Fano resonance) driven by configuration interaction between BCS condensates in large and small Fermi surfaces. Shape resonances usually occur in granular nanoscale complex matter (called superstripes) because of the lattice instability near a 2.5 Lifshitz transition in presence of interactions. Using a new imaging method, scanning nano-X-ray diffraction, we have shown the generic formation in high temperature superconductors of a granular superconducting networks made of striped puddles formed by ordered oxygen interstitials or ordered local lattice distortions (like static short range charge density waves). In the superconducting puddles the chemical potential is tuned to a shape resonance in superconducting gaps and the maximum Tc occurs where the puddles form scale free superconducting networks.},

  abstract = {We give a summary of recent progress in the field of electronic structure calculations for materials with strong electronic Coulomb correlations. The discussion focuses on developments beyond the by now well established combination of density functional and dynamical mean field theory dubbed `LDA + DMFT'. It is organized around the description of dynamical screening effects in the solid. Indeed, screening in the solid gives rise to dynamical local Coulomb interactions U({$\omega$}) (Aryasetiawan et al 2004 Phys. Rev. B 70 195104), and this frequency dependence leads to effects that cannot be neglected in a truly first principles description. We review the recently introduced extension of LDA + DMFT to dynamical local Coulomb interactions `LDA + U({$\omega$}) + DMFT ' (Casula et al 2012 Phys. Rev. B 85 035115, Werner et al 2012 Nature Phys. 1745\textendash 2481). A reliable description of dynamical screening effects is also a central ingredient of the `GW + DMFT' scheme (Biermann et al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett. 90 086402), a combination of many-body perturbation theory in Hedin's GW approximation and dynamical mean field theory. Recently, the first GW + DMFT calculations including dynamical screening effects for real materials have been achieved, with applications to SrVO3 (Tomczak et al 2012 Europhys. Lett. 100 67001, Tomczak et al Phys. Rev. B submitted (available electronically as arXiv:1312.7546)) and adatom systems on surfaces (Hansmann et al 2013 Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 166401). We review these and comment on further perspectives in the field. This review is an attempt to put elements of the original works into the broad perspective of the development of truly first principles techniques for correlated electron materials.},

This difficulty can be avoided by applying a development of the logarithm of the wavefunction in powers of the perturbation parameter. Using the wavefunction so obtained, it is shown, that in the lowest state of a system of many interacting particles no density fluctuations occur. Some properties of the spectrum of energy levels of the many particles system are discussed, and a general proof is given of the existence of an ``excitation energy'', which is necessary to give one particle a motion relatively to the others. As a consequence one could expect that the specific heat of liquid helium II will increase as e(\textemdash a/T), and not with some power of T.},

The phase diagram, studied using a combination of variational mean-field, flavor-wave calculations and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), exhibits a sequence of transitions between the columnar antiferromagnet common to the iron pnictides, the nonmagnetic ferroquadrupolar phase attributed to FeSe, and the double-stripe antiferromagnetic order known to exist in Fe1+yTe. The calculated spin structure factor in these phases mimics closely that observed with INS in the Fe(Te1-xSex) series. In addition to the experimentally established phases, the possibility of incommensurate magnetic order is also predicted.},

To demonstrate the high accuracy of the QMC techniques, we present a detailed study of the energetics of the bulk LiH crystal, using both pseudopotential and all-electron approaches. We show that the equilibrium lattice parameter agrees with experiment to within 0.03 \%, which is around the experimental uncertainty, and the cohesive energy agrees to within around 10 meV per formula unit. QMC in periodic slab geometry is used to compute the formation energy of the LiH (001) surface, and we show that the value can be accurately converged with respect to slab thickness and other technical parameters. The quantum chemistry calculations build on the recently developed hierarchical scheme for computing the correlation energy of a crystal to high precision. We show that the hierarchical scheme allows the accurate calculation of the surface formation energy, and we present results that are well converged with respect to basis set and with respect to the level of correlation treatment. The QMC and hierarchical results for the surface formation energy agree to within about 1 \%.},

These interactions describe the energetics of all possible configurations of the same alloy, which can hence be readily used to identify ground state structures and, through statistical mechanics solutions, find finite-temperature properties. In practice, the biggest challenge is to identify the types of interactions which are most important for a given alloy out of the many possibilities. We describe a genetic algorithm which automates this task. To avoid a possible trapping in a locally optimal interaction set, we periodically ``lock out'' persistent near-optimal cluster expansions. In this way, we identify not only the best possible combination of interaction types but also any near-optimal cluster expansions. Our strategy is not restricted to the cluster expansion method alone, and can be applied to select the qualitative parameter types of any other class of complex model Hamiltonians.},

One simulation provides the density matrix at all temperatures simultaneously, from T={$\infty$} to T=0, allowing the temperature dependence of expectation values to be studied. The direct sampling of the density matrix also allows the calculation of some previously inaccessible entanglement measures. We explain the theory underlying the method, describe the algorithm, and introduce an importance-sampling procedure to improve the stochastic efficiency. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, the energy and staggered magnetization of the isotropic antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on small lattices, the concurrence of one-dimensional spin rings, and the Renyi S2 entanglement entropy of various sublattices of the 6\texttimes 6 Heisenberg model are calculated.

The fcc structure is found to be more stable for all volumes considered and for both LDA models, contrary to a recent prediction of bcc stability at high pressures. The bulk properties exhibit LDA-model dependencies similar to those recently noted in Fe, i.e., the best accord with experiment is achieved with the simple Kohn-Sham-Gaspar model. This somewhat surprising outcome holds not only at equilibrium but for pressures up to 250 kbar. The high-pressure band structure of Li is also presented for the first time. That band structure exhibits rather interesting modifications compared to the zero-pressure band structure.},

We contend that the bias associated to a finite population of walkers is the most likely cause of quantitative numerical discrepancies between PIGS and DMC energy estimates reported in the literature, for this few-body Bose system. We discuss the viability of DMC as a general-purpose ground state technique, and argue that PIGS enjoy more favorable scaling, and represent therefore a superior option for systems of large size.},

Annihilation processes between positive and negative walkers enable the exact N-electron wave function to emerge as a linear superposition of the (factorially large) space of Slater determinants, with individual determinants being stochastically sampled. As a result, extremely large spaces (exceeding 1015 determinants) become accessible for FCI calculations. No fixed-node approximation is necessary, and the only remaining source of error is the one-electron basis set, which can be systematically reduced by enlargement of the basis set. We have investigated the family of aug-cc-pVXZ Dunning basis sets up to X = 5. The resulting ionization potentials are\textemdash with one exception (Na)\textemdash consistently accurate to within chemical accuracy. The anomalous case of Na suggests that its basis set may be improvable. Extrapolation schemes are examined as a way of further improving the values obtained, and although an improvement is seen in the mean-absolute error, the results of extrapolation are not uniformly better than the largest basis set calculations reported. More generally, these results demonstrate the utility of the QMC method to provide FCI energies for realistic systems and basis sets.},

  abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schr\"odinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods\textemdash a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O2, CH4, and NaH\textemdash with FCI spaces ranging from 109 to 1014, whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},

Contraction of the inter-vanadium spacing of the Peierls pairings stabilizes bonding electrons, reducing polarizability and thus widening the band gap. Increases of this inter-vanadium spacing of as little as 1 \textbackslash\% reduce this stabilization, resulting in a crossover to ferromagnetic behaviour accomplished by half of the valence electrons inhabiting the leading edge of the conduction band in localized atomic-like orbitals, as the antiferromagnetic order becomes unstable with respect to rearrangement according to Hund's first rule. The data indicates that the magnetic structure of M1 vanadium dioxide may be finely balanced; the antiferromagnetic order is a consequence of the overlapping nuclear potential of the Peierls pairs, and input which disrupts this will have a significant effect on magnetic properties.},

A d-wave BCS approach based on the large Fermi surface of Fermi liquid and band-structure theory provides a good description of the overdoped region. At underdoping it is essential to include the emergence of a second energy scale, the pseudogap and its associated Gutzwiller factor, which accounts for a reduction in the coherent piece of the electronic Green's function due to increased correlations as the Mott insulating state is approached. In agreement with experiment, we find that the slope of the linear in T dependence of the low-temperature specific heat rapidly increases above optimum doping while it is nearly constant below optimum. Our theoretical calculations also agree with recent data on Bi2Sr2-xLaxCuO6+{$\delta$} for which the normal state is accessed through the application of a large magnetic field.

The analogies with cuprates at different d fillings suggest that intermediate Ce-doping concentrations near 1/8 should be an appropriate place to search for superconductivity in these low-valence Ni oxides.},

The overdoped copper oxides are perceived as simpler, with strongly correlated fermion physics evolving smoothly into the conventional Bardeen\textendash Cooper\textendash Schrieffer behaviour. Pioneering studies on a few overdoped samples indicated that the superfluid density was much lower than expected, but this was attributed to pair-breaking, disorder and phase separation. Here we report the way in which the magnetic penetration depth and the phase stiffness depend on temperature and doping by investigating the entire overdoped side of the La2-xSrxCuO4 phase diagram. We measured the absolute values of the magnetic penetration depth and the phase stiffness to an accuracy of one per cent in thousands of samples; the large statistics reveal clear trends and intrinsic properties. The films are homogeneous; variations in the critical superconducting temperature within a film are very small (less than one kelvin). At every level of doping the phase stiffness decreases linearly with temperature. The dependence of the zero-temperature phase stiffness on the critical superconducting temperature is generally linear, but with an offset; however, close to the origin this dependence becomes parabolic. This scaling law is incompatible with the standard Bardeen\textendash Cooper\textendash Schrieffer description.},

  abstract = {The jellium model of simple metal clusters has enjoyed remarkable empirical success, leading to many theoretical questions. In this review, we first survey the hierarchy of theoretical approximations leading to the model. We then describe the jellium model in detail, including various extensions. One important and useful approximation is the local-density approximation to exchange and correlation effects, which greatly simplifies self-consistent calculations of the electronic structure. Another valuable tool is the semiclassical approximation to the single-particle density matrix, which gives a theoretical framework to connect the properties of large clusters with the bulk and macroscopic surface properties. The physical properties discussed in this review are the ground-state binding energies, the ionization potentials, and the dipole polarizabilities. We also treat the collective electronic excitations from the point of view of the cluster response, including some useful sum rules.},

  abstract = {A system with many degrees of freedom can be characterized by a covariance matrix; principal components analysis (PCA) focuses on the eigenvalues of this matrix, hoping to find a lower dimensional description. But when the spectrum is nearly continuous, any distinction between components that we keep and those that we ignore becomes arbitrary; it then is natural to ask what happens as we vary this arbitrary cutoff. We argue that this problem is analogous to the momentum shell renormalization group (RG). Following this analogy, we can define relevant and irrelevant operators, where the role of dimensionality is played by properties of the eigenvalue density. These results also suggest an approach to the analysis of real data. As an example, we study neural activity in the vertebrate retina as it responds to naturalistic movies, and find evidence of behavior controlled by a nontrivial fixed point. Applied to financial data, our analysis separates modes dominated by sampling noise from a smaller but still macroscopic number of modes described by a non--Gaussian distribution.},

Recombination of photogenerated carriers excites mobile H from Si-H bonds, leaving threefold-coordinated Si dangling-bond defects. When two mobile H atoms collide and associate in a metastable two-H complex, the two dangling bonds from which H was emitted also become metastable. The proposed microscopic mechanism is consistent with electron-spin-resonance experiments. Comprehensive rate equations for the dangling-bond and mobile-H densities are presented; these equations include light-induced creation and annealing. Important regimes are solved analytically and numerically. The model provides explanations for both the t1/3 time dependence of the rise of defect density during continuous illumination and the t1/2 time-dependence during intense laser-pulse illumination. Other consequences and predictions of the H collision model are described.},

We will call such Hamiltonians, which are common in the natural world, stoquastic. An equivalent characterization of stoquastic Hamiltonians is that they have an entry-wise non-negative Gibbs density matrix for any temperature. We prove that LH-MIN for stoquastic Hamiltonians belongs to the complexity class AM -- a probabilistic version of NP with two rounds of communication between the prover and the verifier. We also show that 2-local stoquastic LH-MIN is hard for the class MA. With the additional promise of having a polynomial spectral gap, we show that stoquastic LH-MIN belongs to the class POSTBPP=BPPpath -- a generalization of BPP in which a post-selective readout is allowed. This last result also shows that any problem solved by adiabatic quantum computation using stoquastic Hamiltonians lies in PostBPP.},

The copper valence can be varied in this oxygen-defect perovskite almost continuously from +3 to +2, and three distinct ordered phases are observed over its 0.0{$\leq\delta\leq$}0.5 stability field. A tetragonal phase exists over the composition range 0.0{$<\delta\leq$}0.2, and the structure of a sample with {$\delta$}=0.05 was refined by high-resolution synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction in space group P4/m, with a=3.818 97(4), c=3.972 58(6), and R=0.0812. The tetragonal phase and also a monoclinic form stable between 0.2{$\leq\delta\leq$}0.4 are metallic with room-temperature resistivities of (1.0\textendash 3.0)\texttimes 10-3 {$\Omega$} cm. The phase is orthorhombic for larger {$\delta$}, becoming an insulator as {$\delta\rightarrow$}0.5. Superconductivity was not observed in any of the metallic samples. Ferromagnetic behavior is observed in the tetragonal materials, but the moment disappears at the {$\delta\simeq$}0.2 phase boundary. The small moment is attributed to the existence of a canted antiferromagnetic array in the tetragonal phase. The results are discussed within the contexts of schematic band models and rationalized in terms of one in which the Fermi level moves through partially overlapping copper 3d2x-y2 and oxygen {$\pi$}(2p{$\perp$})* bands as {$\delta$} increases.},

  abstract = {Research-based tools to educate college students in physics courses from introductory level to graduate level are essential for helping students with a diverse set of goals and backgrounds learn physics.  This thesis explores issues related to student common difficulties with some topics in undergraduate quantum mechanics and thermodynamics courses. Student difficulties in learning quantum mechanics and thermodynamics is investigated by administering written tests and surveys to many classes and conducting individual interviews with a subset of students outside the class to unpack the cognitive mechanism of the difficulties. The quantum mechanics research also focuses on using the research on student difficulties for the development and evaluation of a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) to help students learn about the time-dependence of expectation values using the context of Larmor precession of spin and evaluating the role of asking students to self-diagnose their mistakes on midterm examination on their performance on subsequent problem solving. The QuILT on Larmor precession of spin has both paper-pencil activities and a simulation component to help students learn these foundational issues in quantum mechanics.  Preliminary evaluations suggest that the QuILT, which strives to help students build a robust knowledge structure of time-dependence of expectation values in quantum mechanics using a guided approach, is successful in helping students learn these topics in the junior-senior level quantum mechanics courses. The technique to help upper-level students in quantum mechanics courses effectively engage in the process of learning from their mistakes is also found to be effective.  In particular, research shows that the self-diagnosis activity in upper-level quantum mechanics significantly helps students who are struggling and this activity can reduce the gap between the high and low achieving students on subsequent problem solving. Finally, a survey of Thermodynamic Processes and the First and Second Laws (STPFaSL) is developed and validated with the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of these topics in a thermodynamics curriculum.  The validity and reliability of this survey is discussed and the student difficulties with these topics among various groups from introductory students to physics graduate students is cataloged.},

The effective theory is based on a nonlinear realization of the spontaneously broken spin symmetry and makes model-independent universal predictions for the entire class of lightly doped antiferromagnetic precursors of high-temperature superconductors. The predictions of the effective theory are exact, order by order in a systematic low-energy expansion. We derive the one-magnon exchange potentials between two holes in an otherwise undoped system. Remarkably, in some cases the corresponding two-hole Schr\"odinger equations can even be solved analytically. The resulting bound states have d-wave characteristics. The ground state wave function of two holes residing in different hole pockets has a dx2-y2-like symmetry, while for two holes in the same pocket the symmetry resembles dxy.},

In particular, in this paper we consider the use of linear multistep formulae (LMF). Strong order convergence conditions up to order 1 are stated, for both commutative and non-commutative problems. The case of additive noise is further investigated, in order to obtain order improvements. The implementation of the methods is also considered, leading to a predictor-corrector approach.

Using the precise existing data for the Fermi surface topography and quasiparticle velocities of Sr3Ru2O7, we show that in the region of the T-linear resistivity, the scattering rate per kelvin is well approximated by the ratio of the Boltzmann constant to the Planck constant divided by 2{$\pi$}. Extending the analysis to a number of other materials reveals similar results in the T-linear region, in spite of large differences in the microscopic origins of the scattering.

Using results obtained from Monte Carlo simulations on lattices up to 12\texttimes 12 in size, we determine the low-lying quasiparticle dispersion relation. This dispersion relation is anomalously flat near the ({$\pi$},0) and (0,{$\pi$}) points of the Brillouin zone, similar to the results of recent angular resolved photoemission measurements of the hole-doped cuprates. We argue that the generic nature of the quasiparticle dispersion relation observed in these materials arises from the strong Coulomb interaction and reflects the hole-spin correlations rather than the one-electron interactions which customarily determine the band structure.},

An applied transverse electric field separates the first moir\'e conduction band from neighboring bands, and favors the appearance of correlated insulators at 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 band filling. Insulating states at 1/4 and 3/4 band filling emerge only in a parallel magnetic field (B||), whereas the resistivity at half band filling is weakly dependent on B||. Our findings suggest that correlated insulators are favored when a moir\'e flat band is spectrally isolated, and are consistent with a mean-field picture in which insulating states are established by breaking both spin and valley symmetries at 1/4 and 3/4 band filling and valley polarization alone at 1/2 band filling.},

Here we apply highly accurate first-principles quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to obtain structural and magnetic properties of the iron selenide (FeSe) superconductor under pressure. Where comparable, the computed properties are very close to the experimental values. Of potential ordered magnetic configurations, collinear spin configurations are the most energetically favorable over the explored pressure range. They become nearly degenerate in energy with bicollinear spin orderings at around 7 GPa, when the experimental critical temperature Tc is the highest. On the other hand, ferromagnetic, checkerboard, and staggered dimer configurations become relatively higher in energy as the pressure increases. The behavior under pressure is explained by an analysis of the local charge compressibility and the orbital occupation as described by the QMC many-body wave function, which reveals how spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom are strongly coupled in this compound. This remarkable pressure evolution suggests that stripelike magnetic fluctuations may be responsible for the enhanced Tc in FeSe and that higher Tc is associated with nearness to a crossover between collinear and bicollinear ordering.},

It is also found that none of the LSDA (GGA) methods is able to provide, at the same time, accurate electronic and structural properties of NiO. Although the GGA+U method can properly predict the electronic band gap, it overestimates the lattice constant and underestimates the bulk modulus. Then only the LSDA+U method accurately reports the electronic and structural properties of NiO. The calculated band gap and the density of states (DOS) show that the material NiO is the charge-transfer insulator, which agrees with the spectroscopy data. The comparison between the charge density of LSDA (not considering U) and that of LSDA+U (considering U) demonstrates that the trend of ionic crystal for NiO is obvious.},

  abstract = {Understanding and controlling nanoscale morphology is crucial to the performance of polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells, as well as other optoelectronic devices such as polymer light-emitting diodes, field-effect transistors, and sensors. In photovoltaic devices, optimum blend morphologies must be commensurate with the nanometer length scales of exciton diffusion and charge separation. We report on a generally applicable method of optimizing the phase segregation in polymer-polymer bulk heterojunctions based on tuning mixtures of low and high boiling point solvents. We have characterized the resulting blend morphologies with nanometer resolution using a transient absorption technique that probes the distribution of paths traveled by the excitons themselves prior to generating charges at an interface. Photovoltaic efficiencies are accounted for in terms of exciton diffusion, geminate pair separation, and polymer ordering, all of which are sensitive to the nanoscale morphology determined by the composition of the solvent mixture.},

These are exact results that constitute the fulcrum of the recent development of nonequilibrium thermodynamics beyond the linear response regime. The material is organized in a way that emphasizes the historical connection between quantum fluctuation relations and (non)linear response theory. A number of fundamental issues are clarified which were not completely settled in the prior literature. The main focus is on (i) work fluctuation relations for transiently driven closed or open quantum systems, and (ii) on fluctuation relations for heat and matter exchange in quantum transport settings.

By properly taking into account the long-range van der Waals interaction, we provide the patterns for the atomic displacements (with respect to the ideal twisted bilayer). The out-of-plane relaxation shows an oscillating ("buckling") behavior, very evident for the smallest angles, with the atoms around the AA stacking regions interested by the largest displacements. The out-of-plane displacements are accompanied by a significant in-plane relaxation, showing a vortex-like pattern, where the vorticity (intended as curl of the displacement field) is reverted when moving from the top to the bottom plane and viceversa. Overall, the atomic relaxation results in the shrinking of the AA stacking regions in favor of the more energetically favorable AB/BA stacking domains. The measured flat bands emerging at the first magic angle can be accurately described only if the atomic relaxations are taken into account. Quite importantly, the experimental gaps separating the flat band manifold from the higher and lower energy bands cannot be reproduced if only in-plane or only out-of-plane relaxations are considered. The stability of the relaxed bilayer at the first magic angle is estimated to be of the order of 0.5-0.9 meV per atom (or 7-10 K). Our calculations shed light on the importance of an accurate description of the vdW interaction and of the resulting atomic relaxation to envisage the electronic structure of this really peculiar kind of vdW bilayers.},

  abstract = {A van der Waals heterostructure is a type of metamaterial that consists of vertically stacked two-dimensional building blocks held together by the van der Waals forces between the layers. This design means that the properties of van der Waals heterostructures can be engineered precisely, even more so than those of two-dimensional materials1. One such property is the `twist' angle between different layers in the heterostructure. This angle has a crucial role in the electronic properties of van der Waals heterostructures, but does not have a direct analogue in other types of heterostructure, such as semiconductors grown using molecular beam epitaxy. For small twist angles, the moir\'e pattern that is produced by the lattice misorientation between the two-dimensional layers creates long-range modulation of the stacking order. So far, studies of the effects of the twist angle in van der Waals heterostructures have concentrated mostly on heterostructures consisting of monolayer graphene on top of hexagonal boron nitride, which exhibit relatively weak interlayer interaction owing to the large bandgap in hexagonal boron nitride2,3,4,5. Here we study a heterostructure consisting of bilayer graphene, in which the two graphene layers are twisted relative to each other by a certain angle. We show experimentally that, as predicted theoretically6, when this angle is close to the `magic' angle the electronic band structure near zero Fermi energy becomes flat, owing to strong interlayer coupling. These flat bands exhibit insulating states at half-filling, which are not expected in the absence of correlations between electrons. We show that these correlated states at half-filling are consistent with Mott-like insulator states, which can arise from electrons being localized in the superlattice that is induced by the moir\'e pattern. These properties of magic-angle-twisted bilayer graphene heterostructures suggest that these materials could be used to study other exotic many-body quantum phases in two dimensions in the absence of a magnetic field. The accessibility of the flat bands through electrical tunability and the bandwidth tunability through the twist angle could pave the way towards more exotic correlated systems, such as unconventional superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

Moreover, multiple physical phases or domains with dimensions of nanometres to micrometres can coexist in these materials at temperatures where a pure phase is expected. Making use of the properties of correlated electron materials in device applications will require the ability to control domain structures and phase transitions in these materials. Lattice strain has been shown to cause the coexistence of metallic and insulating phases in the Mott insulator VO2. Here, we show that we can nucleate and manipulate ordered arrays of metallic and insulating domains along single-crystal beams of VO2 by continuously tuning the strain over a wide range of values. The Mott transition between a low-temperature insulating phase and a high-temperature metallic phase usually occurs at 341 K in VO2, but the active control of strain allows us to reduce this transition temperature to room temperature. In addition to device applications, the ability to control the phase structure of VO2 with strain could lead to a deeper understanding of the correlated electron materials in general.},

Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity\textemdash which cannot be explained by weak electron\textendash phonon interactions\textemdash in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1\textdegree\textemdash the first `magic' angle\textemdash the electronic band structure of this `twisted bilayer graphene' exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature\textendash carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

Traditional numerical methods often work well, but some of the most interesting problems leave them stumped. Carleo and Troyer harnessed the power of machine learning to develop a variational approach to the quantum many-body problem (see the Perspective by Hush). The method performed at least as well as state-of-the-art approaches, setting a benchmark for a prototypical two-dimensional problem. With further development, it may well prove a valuable piece in the quantum toolbox. Science, this issue p. 602; see also p. 580 The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates from the difficulty of describing the nontrivial correlations encoded in the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with a variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme we demonstrate is capable of both finding the ground state and describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. Our approach achieves high accuracy in describing prototypical interacting spins models in one and two dimensions.

Then, we study the out-of-equilibrium, unitary dynamics induced by a quantum quench in the interaction strength. Our time-dependent variational Monte Carlo results are benchmarked by comparison to exact Bethe ansatz results available for a small number of particles, and are also compared to quench action results available for noninteracting initial states. Moreover, our approach allows us to study large particle numbers and general quench protocols, previously inaccessible beyond the mean-field level.

The atomic displacements associated with this transition stretch the triangular lattice, thus suppressing the geometric frustration. This accounts for the magnetic order observed and gives evidence of a large magnetoelastic coupling.

  abstract = {The classic density-functional theory (DFT) formalism introduced by Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham in the mid-1960s is based on the idea that the complicated N-electron wave function can be replaced with the mathematically simpler 1-electron charge density in electronic structure calculations of the ground stationary state. As such, ordinary DFT cannot treat time-dependent (TD) problems nor describe excited electronic states. In 1984, Runge and Gross proved a theorem making TD-DFT formally exact. Information about electronic excited states may be obtained from this theory through the linear response (LR) theory formalism. Beginning in the mid-1990s, LR-TD-DFT became increasingly popular for calculating absorption and other spectra of medium- and large-sized molecules. Its ease of use and relatively good accuracy has now brought LR-TD-DFT to the forefront for this type of application. As the number and the diversity of applications of TD-DFT have grown, so too has our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the approximate functionals commonly used for TD-DFT. The objective of this article is to continue where a previous review of TD-DFT in Volume 55 of the Annual Review of Physical Chemistry left off and highlight some of the problems and solutions from the point of view of applied physical chemistry. Because doubly-excited states have a particularly important role to play in bond dissociation and formation in both thermal and photochemistry, particular emphasis is placed on the problem of going beyond or around the TD-DFT adiabatic approximation, which limits TD-DFT calculations to nominally singly-excited states.},

The remarkable feature of this approach is that, in principle, several resonating valence bonds can be dealt simultaneously with a single determinant, at a computational cost growing with the number of electrons similar to more conventional methods, such as Hartree-Fock or density functional theory. Moreover we describe an extension of the stochastic reconfiguration method, which was recently introduced for the energy minimization of simple atomic wave functions. Within this extension the atomic positions can be considered as further variational parameters, which can be optimized together with the remaining ones. The method is applied to several molecules from Li2 to benzene by obtaining total energies, bond lengths and binding energies comparable with much more demanding multiconfiguration schemes.\textcopyright{} 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {We introduce a simple generalization of the well-known geminal wave function already applied in quantum chemistry to atoms and small molecules. The main feature of the proposed wave function is the presence of the antisymmetric geminal part together with a Jastrow factor. Both the geminal and the Jastrow play a crucial role in determining the remarkable accuracy of the many-body state: the former permits the correct treatment of the nondynamic correlation effects; the latter allows the wave function to fulfill the cusp conditions and makes the geminal expansion rapidly converge to the lowest possible variational energies. This ansatz is expected to provide a substantial part of the correlation energy for general complex atomic and molecular systems. The antisymmetric geminal term can be written as a single determinant even in the polarized cases. In general, therefore, the computational effort to sample this correlated wave function is not very demanding, the scaling of the algorithm with the number of atoms being comparable with the simplest Hartree\textendash Fock calculation. We applied this Jastrow-geminal approach to atoms up to Z = 14, always getting good variational energies, by particularly improving those with a strong multiconfigurational nature. Our wave function is very useful for Monte Carlo techniques, such as fixed node. Indeed, the nodal surface obtained within this approach can be substantially improved through the geminal expansion. \textcopyright{} 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

We demonstrate that the s- and d-wave channels are determined by the parity under reflection of the electronic orbitals through the iron planes and by improper rotations around the iron sites. We provide evidence of these general properties by performing accurate quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) ab initio calculations of the pairing function, for a FeSe lattice with tetragonal experimental geometry at ambient pressure. We find that this picture survives even in the FeSe under pressure and at low temperatures, when the tetragonal point-group symmetry is slightly broken. In order to achieve a higher resolution in momentum space we introduce a BCS model that faithfully describes our QMC variational pairing function on the simulated 4x4 FeSe unit cell. This allows us to provide a k-resolved image of the pairing function and show that nonisotropic contributions in the BCS gap function are related to the improper s-wave symmetry. Our theory can rationalize and explain a series of contradictory experimental findings, such as the observation of twofold symmetry in the FeSe superconducting phase, the anomalous drop of Tc with Co impurity in LaFeAsO(1-x)Fx, the s- to d-wave gap transition in BaFe2As2 under K doping, and the nodes appearing in the LiFeAs superconducting gap upon P isovalent substitution.},

In this review, the author introduces this picture of a boson superfluid and shows how superfluidity and Bose condensation manifest themselves. He shows the excellent agreement between simulations and experimental measurements on liquid and solid helium for such quantities as pair correlations, the superfluid density, the energy, and the momentum distribution. Major aspects of computational techniques developed for a boson superfluid are discussed: the construction of more accurate approximate density matrices to reduce the number of points on the path integral, sampling techniques to move through the space of exchanges and paths quickly, and the construction of estimators for various properties such as the energy, the momentum distribution, the superfluid density, and the exchange frequency in a quantum crystal.

  abstract = {Cognitive load theory suggests that effective instructional material facilitates learning by directing cognitive resources toward activities that are relevant to learning rather than toward preliminaries to learning. One example of ineffective instruction occurs if learners unnecessarily are required to mentally integrate disparate sources of mutually referring information such as separate text and diagrams. Such split-source information may generate a heavy cognitive load, because material must be mentally integrated before learning can commence. This article reports findings from six experiments testing the consequences of split-source and integrated information using electrical engineering and biology instructional materials. Experiment 1 was designed to compare conventional instructions with integrated instructions over a period of several months in an industrial training setting. The materials chosen were unintelligible without mental integration. Results favored integrated instructions throughout the 3-month study. Experiment 2 was designed to investigate the possible differences between conventional and integrated instructions in areas in which it was not essential for sources of information to be integrated to be understood. The results suggest that integrated instructions were no better than split-source information in such areas. Experiments 3, 4, and 5 indicate that the introduction of seemingly useful but nonessential explanatory material (e.g., a commentary on a diagram) could have deleterious effects even when presented in integrated format. Experiment 6 found that the need for physical integration was restored if the material was organized in such a manner that individual units could not be understood alone. In light of these results and previous findings, suggestions are made for cognitively guided instructional packages.},

The electron correlation was found not to play any major role in the evaluation of polarizability of the lithium clusters, contrary to the case of sodium and other types of clusters. The theoretical methods used in the present study are not able to reproduce the unusual features in the size evolution of the polarizability observed experimentally. An interesting feature is that the polarizability of lithium clusters calculated by various methods at 0K temperature is found to be higher than the experimental results measured at higher temperature, which is quite unusual. The significance of these issues is highlighted and the need of highly accurate DFT exchange-correlation functionals and ab initio methods in the study of the electronic properties of lithium clusters is emphasized. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We show that many interesting wave functions can be mapped exactly onto correlator product states, including Laughlin's quantum Hall wave function, Kitaev's toric code states, and Huse and Elser's frustrated spin states. We also outline the relationship between correlator product states and other common families of variational wave functions such as matrix product states, tensor product states, and resonating valence-bond states. Variational calculations for the Heisenberg and spinless Hubbard models demonstrate the promise of correlator product states for describing both two-dimensional and fermion correlations. Even in one-dimensional systems, correlator product states are competitive with matrix product states for a fixed number of variational parameters.},

In contrast to conventional superconductors, where there is a single temperature scale Tc separating the normal from the superconducting state, the high-temperature superconductors exhibit two additional temperature scales. One is the pseudogap scale T{${_\ast}$}, below which electronic excitations exhibit an energy gap. The second is the coherence scale Tcoh, below which sharp spectral features appear due to increased lifetime of the excitations. We find that T{${_\ast}$} and Tcoh are strongly doping dependent and cross each other near optimal doping.

In the beginning stage of MIT, a significant orbital switching between {$\sigma$}-type dz2 and {$\pi$}-type dx2?y2/dyz accompanied by a large V?V dimerization and a slight twisting angle change opens a band gap of ?0.2 eV, which can be attributed to the electron-correlation-driven Mott transition. After that, the twisting angle of one chain quickly increases, which is accompanied by the appearance of a larger change in band gap from 0.2 to 0.8 eV, even though orbital occupancy is maintained. This finding can be ascribed to the structure-driven Peierls transition. The present study reveals that a staged electron-correlation-driven Mott transition and structure-driven Peierls transition are involved in MIT of VO2.},

  abstract = {We report a new two-dimensional compound, Pb3\textendash xSb1+xS4Te2-{$\delta$}, that has a charge density wave (CDW) at room temperature. The CDW is incommensurate with q-vector of 0.248(6)a* + 0.246(8)b* + 0.387(9)c* for x = 0.29(2) and {$\delta$} = 0.37(3) due to positional and occupational long-range ordering of Te atoms in the sheets. The modulated structure was refined from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction data with a superspace group P{$\overline 1$}({$\alpha\beta\gamma$})0 using (3 + 1)-dimensional crystallography. The resistivity increases with decreasing temperature, suggesting semiconducting behavior. The transition temperature (TCDW) of the CDW is {$\sim$}345 K, above which the Te square sheets become disordered with no q-vector. First-principles density functional theory calculations on the undistorted structure and an approximate commensurate supercell reveal that the gap is due to the structure modulation.},

Hole doping with Sr2+ and Ca2+ in the La site suppresses the antiferromagnetic correlations and transforms the anisotropic magnetic order into a ferromagnetic lattice in all directions. First-principles density functional theory calculations show that the canted magnetic order becomes energetically less favorable compared to the FM order upon hole doping.

Confirming past studies, we find that even trace impurities eliminate the low-temperature commensurate (C) phase in this system. Surprisingly, the magnitude of the in-plane component of the CDW wave vector in the nearly commensurate (NC) phase does not change significantly with Ti concentration, as might be expected from a changing Fermi surface volume. Instead, the angle of the CDW in the basal plane rotates, from 11.9{$\circ$} at x=0 to 16.4{$\circ$} at x=0.12. Ti substitution also leads to an extended region of coexistence between incommensurate (IC) and NC phases, indicating heterogeneous nucleation near the transition. Finally, we explain a resistive anomaly originally observed by Di Salvo [F. J. Di Salvo et al., Phys. Rev. B 12, 2220 (1975)] as arising from pinning of the CDW on the crystal lattice. Our study highlights the importance of commensuration effects in the NC phase, particularly at x{$\sim$}0.08.},

  abstract = {Macromolecular and biomolecular folding landscapes typically contain high free energy barriers that impede efficient sampling of configurational space by standard molecular dynamics simulation. Biased sampling can artificially drive the simulation along prespecified collective variables (CVs), but success depends critically on the availability of good CVs associated with the important collective dynamical motions. Nonlinear machine learning techniques can identify such CVs but typically do not furnish an explicit relationship with the atomic coordinates necessary to perform biased sampling. In this work, we employ auto-associative artificial neural networks (``autoencoders'') to learn nonlinear CVs that are explicit and differentiable functions of the atomic coordinates. Our approach offers substantial speedups in exploration of configurational space, and is distinguished from existing approaches by its capacity to simultaneously discover and directly accelerate along data-driven CVs. We demonstrate the approach in simulations of alanine dipeptide and Trp-cage, and have developed an open-source and freely available implementation within OpenMM. \textcopyright{} 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In contrast, an independent self-consistent many-body calculation of the excitonic order parameter and renormalized band structure is able to capture the experimental phase diagram in extremely good qualitative and quantitative agreement. This demonstrates that electron-electron interactions and the excitonic instability arising from direct electron-hole coupling are pivotal to accurately describe the nature of the CDW in this system. This has important implications to understand the emergence of superconductivity within the CDW phase of this and related systems.},

Previous accurate analytical approaches, however, have a computational complexity that generally increases exponentially with the size of a circuit, making the evaluation of large circuits intractable. This paper presents novel computational models based on stochastic computation, in which probabilities are encoded in the statistics of random binary bit streams, for the reliability evaluation of logic circuits. A computational approach using the stochastic computational models (SCMs) accurately determines the reliability of a circuit with its precision only limited by the random fluctuations inherent in the representation of random binary bit streams. The SCM approach has a linear computational complexity and is therefore scalable for use for any large circuits. Our simulation results demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the SCM approach, and suggest its possible applications in VLSI design.},

Conventional DFT functionals significantly underestimate redox potentials for these compounds. Zhou et al. [Phys. Rev. B 70, 235121 (2004)] addressed this issue with DFT+U and a linear-response scheme for calculating U values. We show that the Li intercalation potentials of prominent Li-ion intercalation battery materials, such as the layered LixMO2 (M=Co and Ni), LixTiS2; olivine LixMPO4 (M=Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni); and spinel-like LixMn2O4, LixTi2O4, are also well reproduced by HSE06, due to the self-interaction error correction from the partial inclusion of Hartree-Fock exchange. For formation energies, HSE06 performs well for transition metal compounds, which typically are not well reproduced by conventional DFT functionals but does not significantly improve the results of nontransition metal oxides. Hence, we find that hybrid functionals provide a good alternative to DFT+U for transition metal applications when the large extra computational effort is compensated by the benefits of (i) avoiding species-specific adjustable parameters and (ii) a more universal treatment of the self-interaction error that is not exclusive to specific atomic orbital projections on selected ions.},

Thereby one benefits from stochastic optimization techniques used in QMC to get optimal pair-correlation functions which typically recover more than 85\% of the total correlation energy. Our approach incorporates, in particular, core and core-valence correlation which are poorly described by homogeneous and isotropic ansatz functions usually applied in F12 calculations. We demonstrate the performance of the tensor product approximation by applications to atoms and small molecules. It turns out that the canonical tensor format is especially suitable for the efficient computation of two- and three-electron integrals required by explicitly correlated methods. The algorithm uses a decomposition of three-electron integrals, originally introduced by Boys and Handy and further elaborated by Ten-no in his 3d numerical quadrature scheme, which enables efficient computations in the tensor format. Furthermore, our method includes the adaptive wavelet approximation of tensor components where convergence rates are given in the framework of best N-term approximation theory.},

  abstract = {A force field for liquid water including polarization effects has been constructed using an artificial neural network (ANN). It is essential to include a many-body polarization effect explicitly into a potential energy function in order to treat liquid water which is dense and highly polar. The new potential energy function is a combination of empirical and nonempirical potentials. The TIP4P model was used for the empirical part of the potential. For the nonempirical part, an ANN with a back-propagation of error algorithm (BPNN) was introduced to reproduce the complicated many-body interaction energy surface from ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. BPNN, described in terms of a matrix, provides enough flexibility to describe the complex potential energy surface (PES). The structural and thermodynamic properties, calculated by isobaric-isothermal (constant-NPT) Monte Carlo simulations with the new polarizable force field for water, are compatible with experimental results. Thus, the simulation establishes the validity of using our estimated PES with a polarization effect for accurate predictions of liquid state properties. Applications of this approach are simple and systematic so that it can easily be applied to the development of other force fields besides the water-water system.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received great attentions because of diverse quantum electronic states such as topological insulating (TI), Weyl semimetallic (WSM) and superconducting states. Recently, the superconducting states emerged in pressurized semimetallic TMDs such as MoTe2 and WTe2 have become one of the central issues due to their predicted WSM states. However, the difficulty in synthetic control of chalcogen vacancies and the ambiguous magneto transport properties have hindered the rigorous study on superconducting and WSM states. Here, we report the emergence of superconductivity at 2.1 K in Te-deficient orthorhombic T d-MoTe2-x with an intrinsic electron-doping, while stoichiometric monoclinic 1T{${'}$}-MoTe2 shows no superconducting state down to 10 mK, but exhibits a large magnetoresistance of 32 000\% at 2 K in a magnetic field of 14 T originating from nearly perfect compensation of electron and hole carriers. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and synchrotron x-ray diffraction combined with theoretical calculations clarify that Te vacancies trigger superconductivity via intrinsic electron doping and the evolution of the T d phase from the 1T{${'}$} phase below 200 K. Unlike the pressure-induced superconducting state of monoclinic MoTe2, this Te vacancy-induced superconductivity is emerged in orthorhombic MoTe2, which is predicted as Weyl semimetal, via electron-doping. This chalcogen vacancy induced-superconductivity provides a new route for cultivating superconducting state together with WSM state in 2D van der Waals materials.},

In both the iron arsenides and the copper oxides, superconductivity arises when an antiferromagnetically ordered phase has been suppressed by chemical doping. A universal feature of the copper oxide superconductors is the existence of a resonant magnetic excitation, localized in both energy and wavevector, within the superconducting phase. This resonance, which has also been observed in several heavy-fermion superconductors, is predicted to occur when the sign of the superconducting energy gap takes opposite values on different parts of the Fermi surface, an unusual gap symmetry which implies that the electron pairing interaction is repulsive at short range. Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy shows no evidence of gap anisotropy in the iron arsenides, but such measurements are insensitive to the phase of the gap on separate parts of the Fermi surface. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering observations of a magnetic resonance below T c in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2, a phase-sensitive measurement demonstrating that the superconducting energy gap has unconventional symmetry in the iron arsenide superconductors.},

Nonetheless, a high-fidelity spin-photon interface, which is a crucial prerequisite for such technologies, has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we demonstrate that such an interface exists in isolated divacancies in epitaxial films of 3C-SiC and 4H-SiC. Our data show that divacancies in 4H-SiC have minimal undesirable spin mixing, and that the optical linewidths in our current sample are already similar to those of recent remote entanglement demonstrations in other systems. Moreover, we find that 3C-SiC divacancies have a millisecond Hahn-echo spin coherence time, which is among the longest measured in a naturally isotopic solid. The presence of defects with these properties in a commercial semiconductor that can be heteroepitaxially grown as a thin film on Si shows promise for future quantum networks based on SiC defects.},

We discuss in detail the normal state properties, the spin fluctuation induced d-wave pairing and the superconducting behavior of a material near an antiferromagnetic instability, when the dominant interaction between quasiparticles is of electronic origin, and at energies much smaller than the fermionic bandwidth, can be viewed as being due to the emission and absorption of a collective, soft spin degree of freedom. We show that in the vicinity of an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point the system behavior is universal, at least when the effective spin fermion interaction is smaller than the fermionic bandwidth. We further argue that spin-fluctuation exchange yields an attraction and pairing in the \$d\_\{x\^\{2\}-y\^\{2\}\}\$ channel in agreement with what nearly all researchers now believe is the pairing symmetry in the cuprates. We discuss "fingerprints" of a spin mediated pairing state, chiefly associated with the emergence of the resonance peak in the spin response in a d-wave superconductor and identify these fingerprints in spectroscopic experiments on optimally doped cuprate superconconductors.},

In the ensuing 25 years, great progress has been made in all areas of HTS research and development, from materials to physics to devices. However, the Tc remains at 134 K in quaternary HBCCO (Hg1223) at ambient pressure achieved in 1993 by Schilling et al. and at 164 K in the same compound under high pressure in the same year by Gao et al. A holistic multidisciplinary enlightened empirical approach has been proposed to search for superconductors with higher Tc, which includes the discovery of new compounds empirically and the realization of novel mechanisms proposed by theorists. Recently, we have observed nonbulk superconductivity in single crystalline rare-earth doped Ca122 samples with an onset Tc of 49 K, higher than the Tc of any known compounds formed of the constituent elements at ambient or under high pressures. Subsequent systematic structural, electrical, magnetic, and calorimetric investigations suggest that the observation may be attributed to an interface-induced Tc, thus suggesting a possible new paradigm for higher Tc. In this presentation, our results will be presented and discussed, following a brief recollection of a few events in our lab in the continuing search for higher Tc, even though a number of review articles have appeared.},

  abstract = {In strongly correlated materials the electronic and optical properties are significantly affected by the coupling of fermionic quasiparticles to different degrees of freedom, such as lattice vibrations and bosonic excitations of electronic origin. Broadband ultrafast spectroscopy [1, 2] is emerging as the premier technique to unravel the subtle interplay between quasiparticles and electronic or phononic collective excitations, by their different characteristic timescales and spectral responses. By investigating the femtosecond dynamics of the optical properties of Bi2Sr2Ca0.92Y0.08Cu2O8+{$\delta$} (Y-Bi2212) crystals over the 0.5\textendash 2 eV energy range, we disentangle the electronic and phononic contributions to the generalized electron-boson Eliashberg function [3, 4], showing that the spectral distribution of the electronic excitations, such as spin fluctuations and current loops, and the strength of their interaction with quasiparticles can account for the high critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition [5]. Finally, we discuss how the use of this technique can be extended to the underdoped region of the phase diagram of cuprates, in which a pseudogap in the quasiparticle density of states opens. The microscopic modeling of the interaction of ultrashort light pulses with unconventional superconductors will be one of the key challenges of the next-years materials science, eventually leading to the full understanding of the role of the electronic correlations in controlling the dynamics on the femtosecond timescale.},

Although Slater-Jastrow wave functions are the most commonly used variational ansatz in electronic structure, more sophisticated wave functions are critical to ascertaining new physics. One such wave function is the multi-Slater-Jastrow wave function which consists of a Jastrow function multiplied by the sum of Slater determinants. In this paper we describe a method for working with these wave functions in QMC codes that is easy to implement, efficient both in computational speed as well as memory, and easily parallelized. The computational cost scales quadratically with particle number making this scaling no worse than the single determinant case and linear with the total number of excitations. Additionally, we implement this method and use it to compute the ground state energy of a water molecule.},

Using classical molecular dynamics, we report the desalination performance of such membranes as a function of pore size, chemical functionalization, and applied pressure. Our results indicate that the membrane?s ability to prevent the salt passage depends critically on pore diameter with adequately sized pores allowing for water flow while blocking ions. Further, an investigation into the role of chemical functional groups bonded to the edges of graphene pores suggests that commonly occurring hydroxyl groups can roughly double the water flux thanks to their hydrophilic character. The increase in water flux comes at the expense of less consistent salt rejection performance, which we attribute to the ability of hydroxyl functional groups to substitute for water molecules in the hydration shell of the ions. Overall, our results indicate that the water permeability of this material is several orders of magnitude higher than conventional reverse osmosis membranes, and that nanoporous graphene may have a valuable role to play for water purification.},

  abstract = {After the discovery of stripelike order in lanthanum-based copper oxide superconductors, charge-ordering instabilities were observed in all cuprate families. However, it has proven difficult to distinguish between unidirectional (stripes) and bidirectional (checkerboard) charge order in yttrium- and bismuth-based materials. We used resonant x-ray scattering to measure the two-dimensional structure factor in the superconductor YBa2Cu3O6+y in reciprocal space. Our data reveal the presence of charge stripe order (i.e., locally unidirectional density waves), which may represent the true microscopic nature of charge modulation in cuprates. At the same time, we find that the well-established competition between charge order and superconductivity is stronger for charge correlations across the stripes than along them, which provides additional evidence for the intrinsic unidirectional nature of the charge order. Picking out the elusive stripes Copper-oxide superconductors have periodic modulations of charge density. Typically, the modulation is not the same for the whole crystal, but breaks up into small nanosized domains. Bulk experiments show that the density is modulated along both axes in the copper-oxide plane, but it is not clear whether this is true only on the scale of the whole crystal or also locally, for each domain. Comin et al. analyzed the charge order in the compound YBa2Cu3O6+y, using resonant x-ray scattering, and found that it was consistent with a local unidirectional, so-called stripy, ordering.

  abstract = {The understanding of the origin of superconductivity in cuprates has been hindered by the apparent diversity of intertwining electronic orders in these materials. We combined resonant x-ray scattering (REXS), scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM), and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to observe a charge order that appears consistently in surface and bulk, and in momentum and real space within one cuprate family, BiSrLaCuO. The observed wave vectors rule out simple antinodal nesting in the single-particle limit but match well with a phenomenological model of a many-body instability of the Fermi arcs. Combined with earlier observations of electronic order in other cuprate families, these findings suggest the existence of a generic charge-ordered state in underdoped cuprates and uncover its intimate connection to the pseudogap regime. Copper-Oxide Superconductors Copper-oxide superconductors have a complex electronic structure. A charge density order has been observed in two cuprate families; however, it has been unclear whether such an order exists in Bi-based compounds (see the Perspective by Morr). Comin et al. (p. 390, published online 19 December) and da Silva Neto et al. (p. 393, published online 19 December) address this question in single-layer and double-layer Bibased cuprates, respectively. For both families of materials, surface measurements by scanning tunneling spectroscopy agree with bulk measurements obtained through resonant elastic x-ray scattering, which suggests the formation of short-range correlations that modulate the charge density of the carriers over a range of dopings. Thus, charge ordering may represent a common characteristic of the major cuprate families.},

We then apply our localized orbital correction approach for transition metals, DBLOC, in an effort to improve the results obtained with both functionals. The PBE0-DBLOC results are remarkably close in both MUE and parameter values to those obtained for the B3LYP-DBLOC method. The M06-DBLOC results are less accurate, but the parameter values and trends are still qualitatively very similar. These results demonstrate that DBLOC corrected methods are substantially more accurate for these systems than any of the uncorrected functionals we have tested and that the deviations between hybrid DFT methods and experiment for transition metal containing systems exhibit striking physically based regularities which are very similar for the three functionals that we have examined, despite significant differences in the details of each model.},

The stretched-exponential time dependence of defect relaxation and the Meyer-Neldel rule for the relaxation-time constant are natural consequences of this model. The results are obtained by using an exponential distribution of activation barriers for transitions between the two states of the local defect. The model, applied to data in hydrogenated amorphous silicon, a-Si:H, gives an exponential distribution of barriers with a characteristic temperature of 220 \textdegree C, roughly equal to the accepted freeze-in temperature for defect distributions in a-Si:H. The model explains that long degradation times convert defects with higher barriers and this results in longer annealing times. The microscopic models of the metastable defects in a-Si:H, weak-bond breaking and carrier trapping by charged dangling bonds, are discussed in the framework of this defect-relaxation model.},

In the limit of fast magnetic sweeps and small molecule fraction, we find that the time scale of molecule production is accurately predicted by a parameter-free model that uses only the atomic densities, masses, and the known Feshbach resonance parameters. We find that molecule production efficiency saturates for slower magnetic sweeps, at which point the maximum number of Feshbach molecules depends primarily on the atoms' phase-space density. At higher temperatures, our measurements agree with a phenomenological model that successfully describes the formation of bosonic molecules from either Bose or Fermi gases. However, for quantum degenerate atom gas mixtures, we measure significantly fewer molecules than this model predicts.},

This occurs in cases in which several physical interactions\textemdash spin, charge, lattice, and/or orbital\textemdash are simultaneously active. This phenomenon causes interesting effects, such as colossal magnetoresistance, and it also appears crucial to understand the high-temperature superconductors. The spontaneous emergence of electronic nanometer-scale structures in transition metal oxides, and the existence of many competing states, are properties often associated with complex matter where nonlinearities dominate, such as soft materials and biological systems. This electronic complexity could have potential consequences for applications of correlated electronic materials, because not only charge (semiconducting electronic), or charge and spin (spintronics) are of relevance, but in addition the lattice and orbital degrees of freedom are active, leading to giant responses to small perturbations. Moreover, several metallic and insulating phases compete, increasing the potential for novel behavior.},

Special emphasis is given to calculations performed with the help of computers applied to models of strongly correlated electrons proposed to describe the two-dimensional CuO2 planes. The review also includes results using several analytical techniques. The one- and three-band Hubbard models and the t-J model are discussed, and their behavior compared against experiments when available. The author found, among the conclusions of the review, that some experimentally observed unusual properties of the cuprates have a natural explanation through Hubbard-like models. In particular, abnormal features like the mid-infrared band of the optical conductivity {$\sigma$}({$\omega$}), the new states observed in the gap in photoemission experiments, the behavior of the spin correlations with doping, and the presence of phase separation in the copper oxide superconductors may be explained, at least in part, by these models. Finally, the existence of superconductivity in Hubbard-like models is analyzed. Some aspects of the recently proposed ideas to describe the cuprates as having a dx2-y2 superconducting condensate at low temperatures are discussed. Numerical results favor this scenario over others. It is concluded that computational techniques provide a useful, unbiased tool for studying the difficult regime where electrons are strongly interacting, and that considerable progress can be achieved by comparing numerical results against analytical predictions for the properties of these models. Future directions of the active field of computational studies of correlated electrons are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {High-transition temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity in the iron pnictides or chalcogenides emerges from the suppression of the static antiferromagnetic order in their parent compounds, similar to copper oxide superconductors. This raises a fundamental question concerning the role of magnetism in the superconductivity of these materials. Neutron scattering, a powerful probe to study the magnetic order and spin dynamics, plays an essential role in determining the relationship between magnetism and superconductivity in high-Tc superconductors. The rapid development of modern neutron time-of-flight spectrometers allows a direct determination of the spin dynamical properties of iron-based superconductors throughout the entire Brillouin zone. In this paper, an overview is presented of the neutron scattering results on iron-based superconductors, focusing on the evolution of spin-excitation spectra as a function of electron and hole doping and isoelectronic substitution. Spin dynamical properties of iron-based superconductors are compared with those of copper oxide and heavy fermion superconductors and the common features of spin excitations in these three families of unconventional superconductors and their relationship with superconductivity are discussed.},

  abstract = {The last decade witnessed significant progress in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and its applications. Today, ARPES experiments with 2-meV energy resolution and 0.2\textdegree{} angular resolution are a reality even for photoemission on solids. These technological advances and the improved sample quality have enabled ARPES to emerge as a leading tool in the investigation of the high-Tc superconductors. This paper reviews the most recent ARPES results on the cuprate superconductors and their insulating parent and sister compounds, with the purpose of providing an updated summary of the extensive literature. The low-energy excitations are discussed with emphasis on some of the most relevant issues, such as the Fermi surface and remnant Fermi surface, the superconducting gap, the pseudogap and d-wave-like dispersion, evidence of electronic inhomogeneity and nanoscale phase separation, the emergence of coherent quasiparticles through the superconducting transition, and many-body effects in the one-particle spectral function due to the interaction of the charge with magnetic and/or lattice degrees of freedom. Given the dynamic nature of the field, we chose to focus mainly on reviewing the experimental data, as on the experimental side a general consensus has been reached, whereas interpretations and related theoretical models can vary significantly. The first part of the paper introduces photoemission spectroscopy in the context of strongly interacting systems, along with an update on the state-of-the-art instrumentation. The second part provides an overview of the scientific issues relevant to the investigation of the low-energy electronic structure by ARPES. The rest of the paper is devoted to the experimental results from the cuprates, and the discussion is organized along conceptual lines: normal-state electronic structure, interlayer interaction, superconducting gap, coherent superconducting peak, pseudogap, electron self-energy, and collective modes. Within each topic, ARPES data from the various copper oxides are presented.},

  abstract = {We investigate the performance of a class of compact and systematically improvable Jastrow-Slater wave functions for the efficient and accurate computation of structural properties, where the determinantal component is expanded with a perturbatively selected configuration interaction scheme (CIPSI).

Spectral signatures of the intermediate coupling scenario are identified and used to adduce that the cuprates fall in the intermediate rather than the weak or the strong coupling limits. A robust, `beyond local-density approximation' framework for obtaining wide-ranging properties of the cuprates via a GW-approximation based self-consistent self-energy correction for incorporating correlation effects is delineated. In this way, doping- and temperature-dependent spectra, from the undoped insulator to the overdoped metal, in the normal as well as the superconducting state, with features of both weak and strong coupling can be modeled in a material-specific manner with very few parameters. Efficacy of the model is shown by considering available spectroscopic data on electron- and hole-doped cuprates from angle-resolved photoemission, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, neutron scattering, inelastic light scattering, optical and other experiments. Generalizations to treat systems with multiple correlated bands such as the heavy-fermions, the ruthenates and the actinides are discussed.},

These excitations are strikingly similar to the bosons proposed to explain the high-energy ``kink'' observed in photoemission. A phenomenological calculation of the spin response, based on a parametrization of the the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy derived electronic structure and Yang-Rice-Zhang quasiparticles, provides a reasonable prediction of the energy dispersion of the observed magnetic excitations. These results indicate a possible unified framework to reconcile the magnetic and electronic properties of the cuprates and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach.},

For alloys, cluster expansion Hamiltonians can coarse-grain out the complex, many-body electron problem of density functional theory, yielding a series of simple site-wise basis functions (e.g., products of site occupancy variables) on an atomic scale. The resulting energy polynomial is computationally inexpensive, and hence suitable for the (tens of) thousands of calculations of large systems required by stochastic methods. We present a new method to run the statical mechanics problem "in reverse", using high-temperature observations and thermodynamic connections to construct an effective Hamiltonian and thereby predict the 0 Kelvin energy spectrum and associated ground states. By re-examining the cluster expansion formalism through the lens of entropy-maximization approaches, we develop an algorithm to select clusters and determine cluster interactions using only a few, high-temperature experiments on disordered phases. We demonstrate that our approach can recover not only the stable ground states at 0 Kelvin, but also the full phase behavior for three realistic two-dimensional and three-dimensional alloy test-cases.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses some effects of mobile electrons in some antiferromagnetic lattices. It is shown that these electrons (or holes) always give rise to a distortion of the ground state spin arrangement, since electron transfer lowers the energy by a term of first order in the distortion angles. In the most typical cases this results in: (a) a nonzero spontaneous moment in low fields; (b) a lack of saturation in high fields; (c) simultaneous occurrence of "ferromagnetic" and "antiferromagnetic" lines in neutron diffraction patterns; (d) both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic branches in the spin wave spectra. Some of these properties have indeed been observed in compounds of mixed valency such as the manganites with low Mn4+ content. Similar considerations apply at finite temperatures, at least for the (most widespread) case where only the bottom of the carrier band is occupied at all temperatures of interest. The free energy is computed by a variational procedure, using simple carrier wave functions and an extension of the molecular field approximation. It is found that the canted arrangements are stable up to a well-defined temperature T1. Above T1 the system is either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic, depending upon the relative amount of mobile electrons. This behavior is not qualitatively modified when the carriers which are responsible for double exchange fall into bound states around impurity ions of opposite charge. Such bound states, however, will give rise to local inhomogeneities in the spin distortion, and to diffuse magnetic peaks in the neutron diffraction pattern. The possibility of observing these peaks and of eliminating the spurious spin-wave scattering is discussed in an Appendix.},

In contrast, considering just the Coulomb binding of the polaron pair, electric fields above 108 V/m would be needed to reach similar yields. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we performed kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of polaron-pair dissociation in donor-acceptor blends, considering delocalized charge carriers along conjugated polymer chain segments. We show that the resulting fast local charge carrier transport can indeed explain the high experimental quantum yields in polymer solar cells.},

These dynamic antiferromagnetic correlations are weakly dependent of neutron-energy transfer and temperature, and persist up to 25 meV and 120 K. At low energy transfers a shift of the magnetic scattering to low Q is observed with increasing temperature, providing evidence of gapless spinons. It is argued that these observations provide important evidence in favor of resonating-valence-bond theories of (doped) Mott insulators.},

This unusual phase of iron arsenic high-temperature superconductors was hard to measure as it exists only under pressure. By inducing internal strain, via the postgrowth thermal treatment of single crystals, we were able to stabilize the CT phase at ambient pressure. We find significant differences in the Fermi surface topology and band dispersion data from the more common orthorhombic-antiferromagnetic or tetragonal-paramagnetic phases, consistent with electronic structure calculations. The top of the hole bands sinks below the Fermi level, which destroys the nesting present in parent phases. The absence of nesting in this phase, along with an apparent loss of Fe magnetic moment, are now clearly experimentally correlated with the lack of superconductivity in this phase.},

One important example is the appearance of superconductivity at the interface between insulating oxides, although, until now, with very low Tc. We report the occurrence of high Tc superconductivity in the bilayer CaCuO2/SrTiO3, where both the constituent oxides are insulating. In order to obtain a superconducting state, the CaCuO2/SrTiO3 interface must be realized between the Ca plane of CaCuO2 and the TiO2 plane of SrTiO3. Only in this case can oxygen ions be incorporated in the interface Ca plane, acting as apical oxygen for Cu and providing holes to the CuO2 planes. A detailed hole doping spatial profile can be obtained by scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron-energy-loss spectroscopy at the O K edge, clearly showing that the (super)conductivity is confined to about 1\textendash 2 CaCuO2 unit cells close to the interface with SrTiO3. The results obtained for the CaCuO2/SrTiO3 interface can be extended to multilayered high Tc cuprates, contributing to explaining the dependence of Tc on the number of CuO2 planes in these systems.},

In this paper we review experimental and theoretical work done on this system in our groups in recent years. The analysis is largely based on electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and on their interpretation based on high-level ab initio calculations. N-doped anatase TiO2 contains thermally stable single N-atom impurities either as charged diamagnetic N b - centers or as neutral paramagnetic N b centers (b stays for bulk). The N-atoms can occupy both interstitial or substitutional positions in the solid, with some evidence for a preference for interstitial sites. All types of Nb centers give rise to localized states in the band-gap of the oxide, thus accounting for the related reduction of absorption band edge. The relative abundance of these species depends on the oxidation state of the solid. In fact, upon reduction, oxygen vacancies form and transfer electrons from Ti3+ ions to the N b with formation of Ti4+ and N b - . EPR spectra measured under irradiation show that the Nb centers are responsible for visible light absorption with promotion of electrons from the localized N-impurity states to the conduction band or to electron scavengers like O2 adsorbed on the surface. These results provide an unambiguous characterization of the electronic states associated with N-impurities in TiO2 and a realistic picture of the processes occurring in the solid under irradiation with visible light.},

  abstract = {Despite twenty years of research, the phase diagram of high-transition-temperature superconductors remains enigmatic. A central issue is the origin of the differences in the physical properties of these copper oxides doped to opposite sides of the superconducting region. In the overdoped regime, the material behaves as a reasonably conventional metal, with a large Fermi surface. The underdoped regime, however, is highly anomalous and appears to have no coherent Fermi surface, but only disconnected 'Fermi arcs'. The fundamental question, then, is whether underdoped copper oxides have a Fermi surface, and if so, whether it is topologically different from that seen in the overdoped regime. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations in the electrical resistance of the oxygen-ordered copper oxide YBa2Cu3O6.5, establishing the existence of a well-defined Fermi surface in the ground state of underdoped copper oxides, once superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic field. The low oscillation frequency reveals a Fermi surface made of small pockets, in contrast to the large cylinder characteristic of the overdoped regime. Two possible interpretations are discussed: either a small pocket is part of the band structure specific to YBa2Cu3O6.5 or small pockets arise from a topological change at a critical point in the phase diagram. Our understanding of high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors will depend critically on which of these two interpretations proves to be correct.},

Metal atoms adsorbed on surfaces can develop strong magnetization in an applied field (paramagnetism). Donati et al. show that single holmium atoms adsorbed on a magnesium oxide film grown on a silver substrate show residual magnetism for temperatures up to 30 K and bistabilty that lasts for 1500 s at 10 K (see the Perspective by Khajetoorians and Heinrich). The atom avoids spin relaxation by a combination of quantum-state symmetry and by the oxide film preventing the spin from interacting with the underlying metal via tunneling. Science, this issue p. 318; see also p. 296 A permanent magnet retains a substantial fraction of its saturation magnetization in the absence of an external magnetic field. Realizing magnetic remanence in a single atom allows for storing and processing information in the smallest unit of matter. We show that individual holmium (Ho) atoms adsorbed on ultrathin MgO(100) layers on Ag(100) exhibit magnetic remanence up to a temperature of 30 kelvin and a relaxation time of 1500 seconds at 10 kelvin. This extraordinary stability is achieved by the realization of a symmetry-protected magnetic ground state and by decoupling the Ho spin from the underlying metal by a tunnel barrier. A single holmium atom on a magnesium oxide film can retain its magnetic moment up to 30 kelvin.

Nanoscale reconstructions, unique to curved nanosurfaces, are presented for silicon nanocrystals and shown to have lower energy and larger optical gaps than bulk-derived structures. We find that high-temperature synthesis processes can produce metastable noncrystalline nanostructures with different core structures than bulk-derived crystalline clusters. The type of core structure that forms from a given synthesis process may depend on the passivation mechanism and time scale. The effect of oxygen on the optical of different types of silicon structures is calculated. In contrast to the behavior of bulklike nanostructures, for noncrystalline and reconstructed crystalline structures surface oxygen atoms do not decrease the gap. In some cases, the presence of oxygen atoms at the nanocluster surface can significantly increase the optical absorption gap, due to decreased angular distortion of the silicon bonds. The relationship between strain and the optical gap in silicon nanoclusters is discussed. \textcopyright{} 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

Our molecular modeling studies reveal analogous transparency in case of submerged graphene fragments in water. A combined effect of attractive dispersion forces, angle correlations between aqueous dipoles, and repulsion due to the hydrogen-bond-induced orientation bias in polarized hydration layers acting across graphene sheet, enhances apparent adhesion of water to graphene. We show wetting free energy of a fully wetted graphene platelet to be about 8 mNm-1 lower than for graphene wetted only on one side, which gives close to 10\textdegree{} reduction in contact angle. This difference has potential implications for predictions of water absorption vs. desorption, phase behavior of water in aqueous nanoconfinements, solvent-induced interactions among graphitic nanoparticle and concomitant stability in aqueous dispersions, and can influence permeability of porous materials such as carbon nanotubes by water and aqueous solutions.},

  abstract = {Octahedral Fe2+ molecules are particularly interesting as they often exhibit a spin-crossover transition. In spite of the many efforts aimed at assessing the performances of density functional theory for such systems, an exchange-correlation functional able to account accurately for the energetic of the various possible spin-states has not been identified yet. Here, we critically discuss the issues related to the theoretical description of this class of molecules from first principles. In particular, we present a comparison between different density functionals for four ions, namely, [Fe(H2O)6]2+, [Fe(NH3)6]2+, [Fe(NCH)6]2+, and [Fe(CO)6]2+. These are characterized by different ligand-field splittings and ground state spin multiplicities. Since no experimental data are available for the gas phase, the density functional theory results are benchmarked against those obtained with diffusion Monte Carlo, one of the most accurate methods available to compute ground state total energies of quantum systems. On the one hand, we show that most of the functionals considered provide a good description of the geometry and of the shape of the potential energy surfaces. On the other hand, the same functionals fail badly in predicting the energy differences between the various spin states. In the case of [Fe(H2O)6]2+, [Fe(NH3)6]2+, [Fe(NCH)6]2+, this failure is related to the drastic underestimation of the exchange energy. Therefore, quite accurate results can be achieved with hybrid functionals including about 50\% of Hartree-Fock exchange. In contrast, in the case of [Fe(CO)6]2+, the failure is likely to be caused by the multiconfigurational character of the ground state wave-function and no suitable exchange and correlation functional has been identified.},

  abstract = {Establishing the phase diagram of hydrogen is a major challenge for experimental and theoretical physics. Experiment alone cannot establish the atomic structure of solid hydrogen at high pressure, because hydrogen scatters X-rays only weakly. Instead, our understanding of the atomic structure is largely based on density functional theory (DFT). By comparing Raman spectra for low-energy structures found in DFT searches with experimental spectra, candidate atomic structures have been identified for each experimentally observed phase. Unfortunately, DFT predicts a metallic structure to be energetically favoured at a broad range of pressures up to 400\,GPa, where it is known experimentally that hydrogen is non-metallic. Here we show that more advanced theoretical methods (diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations) find the metallic structure to be uncompetitive, and predict a phase diagram in reasonable agreement with experiment. This greatly strengthens the claim that the candidate atomic structures accurately model the experimentally observed phases.},

  abstract = {Many students are being left behind by an educational system that some people believe is in crisis. Improving educational outcomes will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this monograph is that one part of a solution involves helping students to better regulate their learning through the use of effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and educational psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achieve their learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily on them, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice., To offer recommendations about the relative utility of these techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generalize across four categories of variables: learning conditions, student characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning conditions include aspects of the learning environment in which the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies alone or with a group. Student characteristics include variables such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials vary from simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measures that are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping memory, problem solving, and comprehension., We attempted to provide thorough reviews for each technique, so this monograph is rather lengthy. However, we also wrote the monograph in a modular fashion, so it is easy to use. In particular, each review is divided into the following sections: , , The review for each technique can be read independently of the others, and particular variables of interest can be easily compared across techniques., To foreshadow our final recommendations, the techniques vary widely with respect to their generalizability and promise for improving student learning. Practice testing and distributed practice received high utility assessments because they benefit learners of different ages and abilities and have been shown to boost students' performance across many criterion tasks and even in educational contexts. Elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved practice received moderate utility assessments. The benefits of these techniques do generalize across some variables, yet despite their promise, they fell short of a high utility assessment because the evidence for their efficacy is limited. For instance, elaborative interrogation and self-explanation have not been adequately evaluated in educational contexts, and the benefits of interleaving have just begun to be systematically explored, so the ultimate effectiveness of these techniques is currently unknown. Nevertheless, the techniques that received moderate-utility ratings show enough promise for us to recommend their use in appropriate situations, which we describe in detail within the review of each technique., Five techniques received a low utility assessment: summarization, highlighting, the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, and rereading. These techniques were rated as low utility for numerous reasons. Summarization and imagery use for text learning have been shown to help some students on some criterion tasks, yet the conditions under which these techniques produce benefits are limited, and much research is still needed to fully explore their overall effectiveness. The keyword mnemonic is difficult to implement in some contexts, and it appears to benefit students for a limited number of materials and for short retention intervals. Most students report rereading and highlighting, yet these techniques do not consistently boost students' performance, so other techniques should be used in their place (e.g., practice testing instead of rereading)., Our hope is that this monograph will foster improvements in student learning, not only by showcasing which learning techniques are likely to have the most generalizable effects but also by encouraging researchers to continue investigating the most promising techniques. Accordingly, in our closing remarks, we discuss some issues for how these techniques could be implemented by teachers and students, and we highlight directions for future research.},

Here we show that the long-held belief that the quantum spin fluctuations of the antiferromagnetic background play a key role in determining this dynamics is wrong. Indeed, we demonstrate that the correct, experimentally observed quasiparticle dispersion is generically obtained for a three-band model describing the hole moving on the oxygen sublattice and coupled to a N\'eel lattice of spins without spin fluctuations. We argue that results from one-band model studies actually support this conclusion, and that this significant conceptual change in our understanding of this phenomenology opens the way to studying few-hole dynamics, to accurately gauge the strength of the `magnetic glue' and its contribution to superconductivity.},

Analysis of the 298 K data confirm and improve on an existing X-ray structure determination in Pbnm. The same orthorhombic cell and space group are consistent with the data at all temperatures studied. The cell constants show anisotropy as b and c decrease with temperature and a increases slightly. There are no significant changes in Ti-O bond lengths or Ti-O-Ti angles with temperature. In the La-O polyhedron the eight nearest-neighbour bond distances decrease with decreasing temperature while the next four increase demonstrating a tendency to eightfold coordination.

Using SP-STM to visualize magnetic order in strongly correlated materials on an atomic scale is highly desirable, but challenging. We achieved this goal in iron tellurium (Fe1+yTe), the nonsuperconducting parent compound of the iron chalcogenides, by using a STM tip with a magnetic cluster at its apex. Our images of the magnetic structure reveal that the magnetic order in the monoclinic phase is a unidirectional stripe order; in the orthorhombic phase at higher excess iron concentration (y {$>$} 0.12), a transition to a phase with coexisting magnetic orders in both directions is observed. It may be possible to generalize the technique to other high-temperature superconductor families, such as the cuprates. Seeing magnetism on an atomic level Electrons tunneling from the magnetized tip of a scanning tunneling microscope into the surface of a material can reveal the material's magnetic structure. Although researchers have used the technique on simple nanostructures, they've had trouble preparing the tip in just the right way to visualize the magnetic order in more exotic materials. Enayat et al. used a tip with a magnetic cluster on its apex to reveal patterns of magnetic ordering in the material Fe1+yTe, which becomes superconducting by substituting Te with Se atoms.

The new algorithm exploits the advantages arising from the subdivision of the molecular orbitals (MOs) into an internal and an external part and avoids the recalculation of representation matrices by the use of a specially designed cache. With the new algorithms we are able to perform calculations including more than 10 million selected configurations state functions (CSFs) as a matter of routine. As an example for the possibilities of the new approach the regioselectivity of thermal biradical cyclizations (C2C7 vs. C2C6 cyclization) is investigated in the second part of the present work. After studying the accuracy of various quantum chemical methods (MR-CI, density functional theory, and coupled cluster approaches) using (Z)-1,2,4 Heptatriene-6-yne as a model system the influence of substituents (R=H, Ph, t-Bu, NH2) on the regioselectivity is investigated. Our results rationalize the switch between the two biradical cyclizations on the basis of mainly steric (t-Bu) or electronic (Ph) substituent effects. Moreover, the results for R=NH2 predict that the activation energy of the C2C6 cyclization can be lowered even more. However, a change in the reaction mechanism is found.},

The ions investigated in this study (Ti4+, Nb5+, Ta5+, Mo6+, and W6+) were examined primarily in perovskite and perovskite-related structures. In these compounds the top of the valence band is primarily oxygen 2p non-bonding in character, while the conduction band arises from the \"I\texteuro\^a\textasciicircum\textemdash{} interaction between the transition metal t2g orbitals and oxygen. For isostructural compounds the band gap increases as the effective electronegativity of the transition metal ion decreases. The effective electronegativity decreases in the following order: Mo6+\&gt;W6+\&gt;Nb5+\^a\textasciicircum{$\frac{1}{4}$}Ti4+\&gt;Ta5+. The band gap is also sensitive to changes in the conduction band width, which is maximized for structures possessing linear M\^a\texteuro ``O\^a\texteuro ``M bonds, such as the cubic perovskite structure. As this bond angle decreases (e.g., via octahedral tilting distortions) the conduction band narrows and the band gap increases. Decreasing the dimensionality from 3-D (e.g., the cubic perovskite structure) to 2-D (e.g., the K2NiF4 structure) does not significantly alter the band gap, whereas completely isolating the MO6 octahedra (e.g., the ordered double perovskite structure) narrows the conduction band width dramatically and leads to a significant increase in the band gap. Inductive effects due to the presence of electropositive \^a\texteuro\oe spectator\^a\texteuro  cations (alkali, alkaline earth, and rare-earth cations) tend to be small and can generally be neglected.},

The method is based on fitting the potential to ab initio atomic forces of many atomic configurations, including surfaces, clusters, liquids and crystals at finite temperature. The extensive data set overcomes the difficulties encountered by traditional fitting approaches when using rich and complex analytic forms, allowing to construct potentials with a degree of accuracy comparable to that obtained by ab initio methods. A glue potential for aluminium obtained with this method is presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {We review recent experimental and theoretical results on the interaction between single-particle excitations and collective spin excitations in the superconducting state of high-Tc cuprates. We concentrate on the traces that sharpen features in the magnetic-excitation spectrum (measured by inelastic neutron scattering) and imprint in the spectra of single-particle excitations (measured, e.g. by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, tunnelling spectroscopy, and indirectly also by optical spectroscopy). The ideal object to obtain a quantitative picture for these interaction effects is a spin-1 excitation around 40 meV, termed `resonance mode'. Although the total weight of this spin-1 excitation is small, the confinement of its weight to a rather narrow momentum region around the antiferromagnetic wavevector makes it possible to observe strong self-energy effects in parts of the electronic Brillouin zone. Notably, the sharpness of the magnetic excitation in energy has allowed these self-energy effects to be traced in the single-particle spectrum rather precisely. Namely, the doping and temperature dependence together with the characteristic energy and momentum behaviour of the resonance mode has been used as a tool to examine the corresponding self-energy effects in the dispersion and in the spectral line-shape of the single-particle spectra, and to separate them from similar effects due to the electron\textendash phonon interaction. This leads to the unique possibility to single out the self-energy effects due to the spin\textendash fermion interaction and to directly determine the strength of this interaction in high-Tc cuprate superconductors. The knowledge of this interaction is important for the interpretation of other experimental results as well as for the quest for the still unknown pairing mechanism in these interesting superconducting materials.

In contrast to present experimental approaches, small systematic errors in the theoretical EOS do not increase with pressure, and no extrapolation is needed.

At the same time, a low-lying plasma mode of the electronic system appears for wave vectors in the (0,0,1) direction which mixes strongly with the phonons of appropriate symmetry and leads in addition to the phonons to very large changes of the crystal potential. Such a coexistence of phononlike and plasmonlike modes in the same frequency range is argued to be a specific feature of the HTSC's related to their layered structure and weak screening of the strong ionic forces in the c direction. It leads to a significant increase of the retarded attractive interaction and provides, at least in part, an understanding of the reduction of the oxygen isotope effect in these materials, which is difficult to explain for a pure (harmonic) electron-phonon superconductor.},

The local part of the density response and the electron-phonon interaction is approximated by an improved model of rigid ions using effective ionic charges as calculated from a tight-binding analysis of the first-principles electronic band structure. Moreover, covalence effects are simulated by scaling the short-range part of the relevant ab initio pair potentials. Such a model serves as a reference system describing the insulating phase. Phonon dispersion curves are calculated in this model and good overall agreement with recent experiments is found. In the case of the metallic phase, specific nonlocal screening effects in terms of localized charge fluctuations are additionally introduced at the ions by a parameter-free procedure. In the framework of the improved reference system, phonon dispersion curves and phonon-induced changes of the crystal potential are calculated for the metallic phase. Characteristic changes in the phonon dispersion produced by the insulator-metal transition are discussed and compared with the experiments. Further, c-axis phonon-plasmon mixing is investigated. Phonon-plasmon coupling leads in particular to an additional softening of the symmetrical apical oxygen breathing mode at the Z point (OZz) being important in context with nonlocal electron-phonon interaction and pair binding. In this way the already large decrease in frequency of this phonon predicted in our earlier work in the adiabatic approximation as compared to the calculated frequency of OZz in the insulating phase is further enhanced. The anomalous large renormalization of this mode has been confirmed quite recently by the experiments. A final remark is concerned with the oxygen isotope effect in the high-temperature superconductors from the viewpoint of phonon-plasmon coupling.},

The functional form, in addition to the dependence on the distance, includes the angular dependence that results from higher angular momentum components in the Wannier pz orbitals.

  abstract = {A monolayer of many talents Superconductors with a topologically nontrivial band structure have been predicted to exhibit exotic properties. However, such materials are few and far between. Now, two groups show that the monolayer of the material tungsten ditelluride (WTe2)\textemdash already known to be a two-dimensional topological insulator\textemdash can also go superconducting. Fatemi et al. and Sajadi et al. varied the carrier density in the monolayer by applying a gate voltage and observed a transition from a topological to a superconducting phase. The findings may lead to the fabrication of devices in which local gating enables topological and superconducting phases to exist in the same material. Science, this issue p. 926, p. 922 Turning on superconductivity in a topologically nontrivial insulator may provide a route to search for non-Abelian topological states. However, existing demonstrations of superconductor-insulator switches have involved only topologically trivial systems. Here we report reversible, in situ electrostatic on-off switching of superconductivity in the recently established quantum spin Hall insulator monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2). Fabricated into a van der Waals field-effect transistor, the monolayer's ground state can be continuously gate-tuned from the topological insulating to the superconducting state, with critical temperatures Tc up to \textasciitilde 1 kelvin. Our results establish monolayer WTe2 as a material platform for engineering nanodevices that combine superconducting and topological phases of matter. Modulating carrier concentration induces a transition from a topological to a superconducting phase in monolayer WTe2. Modulating carrier concentration induces a transition from a topological to a superconducting phase in monolayer WTe2.},

Our motivation is to construct a model Hamiltonian (excluding effects due to spin-orbit coupling), which can provide an accurate description of the magnetism in these materials. First, we consider TbMnO3, which exhibits a spiral magnetic order at low temperatures. We map the exchange couplings in this compound onto a Heisenberg Hamiltonian and observe a clear deviation from the Heisenberg-like behavior. We consider first the coupling between magnetic and orbital degrees of freedom as a potential source of non-Heisenberg behavior in TbMnO3, but conclude that it does not explain the observed deviation. We find that higher order magnetic interactions (biquadratic and four-spin ring couplings) should be taken into account for a proper treatment of the magnetism in TbMnO3 as well as in the other representatives of the o-RMnO3 series with small radii of the R cation.},

The improved spectral resolution at high magnetic field reveals a rhombic splitting of the g-tensor with the following principal values: g\_x=2.0080, g\_y=2.0060 and g\_z=2.0033 and shows pronounced g-strain, i.e., the principal values are widely distributed. The multifrequency approach furthermore yields precise 29Si hyperfine data. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on 27 computer-generated a-Si:H dangling-bond models yielded g-values close to the experimental data but deviating hyperfine interaction values. We show that paramagnetic coordination defects in a-Si:H are more delocalized than computer-generated dangling-bond defects and discuss models to explain this discrepancy. In addition to coordination defects, we observed, for the first time, paramagnetic centers which show a strong 1H hyperfine interaction of 320 MHz. These centers are possibly due to paramagnetic configurations of Si-Si bond-centered hydrogen atoms, or spatially correlated hydrogen/dangling-bond centers.},

  abstract = {Although the existence of nematic order in iron-based superconductors is now a well-established experimental fact, its origin remains controversial. Nematic order breaks the discrete lattice rotational symmetry by making the x and y directions in the iron plane non-equivalent. This can happen because of a regular structural transition or as the result of an electronically driven instability \textemdash{} in particular, orbital order or spin-driven Ising-nematic order. The latter is a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but preserves time-reversal symmetry. Symmetry dictates that the development of one of these orders immediately induces the other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of the `chicken and egg problem'. In this Review, we argue that the evidence strongly points to an electronic mechanism of nematicity, placing nematic order in the class of correlation-driven electronic instabilities, like superconductivity and density-wave transitions. We discuss different microscopic models for nematicity and link them to the properties of the magnetic and superconducting states, providing a unified perspective on the phase diagram of the iron pnictides.},

The two degrees of freedom of this effective model can be associated to the nodal and antinodal regions of momentum space. We find a metal-insulator transition which is selective in momentum space. At low doping, quasiparticles are destroyed in the antinodal region, while they remain protected in the nodal region, leading to the formation of apparent Fermi arcs. We compare our results to tunneling and angular-resolved photoemission experiments on cuprates. At very low energy, a simple description of this transition can be given using rotationally invariant slave bosons.},

A new wave function is proposed here. The new value computed for {$\Delta$} is 11.5\textdegree K. Qualitatively, the wave function suggests that the roton is a kind of quantum-mechanical analog of a microscopic vortex ring, of diameter about equal to the atomic spacing.

Vanadium dioxide exhibits a first-order phase transition at around 338 K between a high-temperature, tetragonal, metallic state (T) and a low-temperature, monoclinic, insulating state (M1), driven by electron?electron and electron?lattice interactions. Intercalation of VO2 with atomic hydrogen has been demonstrated, with evidence that this doping suppresses the transition. However, the detailed effects of intercalated H on the crystal and electronic structure of the resulting hydride have not been previously reported. Here we present synchrotron and neutron diffraction studies of this material system, mapping out the structural phase diagram as a function of temperature and hydrogen content. In addition to the original T and M1 phases, we find two orthorhombic phases, O1 and O2, which are stabilized at higher hydrogen content. We present density functional calculations that confirm the metallicity of these states and discuss the physical basis by which hydrogen stabilizes conducting phases, in the context of the metal?insulator transition.},

These include time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), complete-active-space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2), equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC), and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. We find that all approaches give roughly the same vertical excitation for the anionic form, while TDDFT predicts an excitation for the neutral chromophore significantly lower than the highly correlated methods. Our findings support the picture emerging from the extrapolation of the Kamlet-Taft fit of absorption experimental data in solution and indicate that the protein gives rise to a considerable bathochromic shift with respect to vacuum. These results also open some questions on the interpretation of photodestruction spectroscopy experiments in the gas phase as well as on the accuracy of previous theoretical calculations in the more complex protein environment.},

On the basis of the results we are able to estimate the magnitude of various errors related to the use of pseudopotentials in quantum Monte Carlo calculations for transition metals. From a comparison of coupled cluster valence-only and all-electron results, respectively, of the experimental data we estimate the errors due to the semilocal pseudopotential to be at most 0.1 eV. The average error of pure diffusion quantum Monte Carlo results with respect to experimental data amounts to 0.2 eV and arises mainly from errors due to the semilocal pseudopotential, its localization and the fixed-node approximation used in the quantum Monte Carlo calculations. The errors appear to be closely related to the occupation of the 3d shell. \textcopyright{} 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract = {We present density functional theory (DFT) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the glutamic acid and glutamate ion in vacuo and in various dielectric continuum media within the polarizable continuum model (PCM). In DFT, we employ the integral equation formalism variant of PCM while, in QMC, we use a PCM scheme we have developed to include both surface and volume polarization. We investigate the gas-phase protonation thermochemistry of the glutamic acid using a large set of structural conformations, and find that QMC is in excellent agreement with the best available theoretical and experimental results. For the solvated glutamic acid and glutamate ion, we perform DFT calculations for dielectric constants, {$\epsilon$}, between 4 and 78. We find that the glutamate ion in the zwitterionic form is more stable than the non-zwitterionic form over the whole range of dielectric constants, while the glutamic acid is more stable in its non-zwitterionic form at {$\epsilon$} = 4. The dielectric constant at which the two glutamic acid species have the same energy depends on the cavity size and lies between 5 and 12.5. We validate these results with QMC for the two limiting values of the dielectric constant, and find qualitative agreement with DFT even though the solvent polarization is less pronounced at the QMC level.},

They complement the less demanding density-functional approach by providing more accurate results and a deeper understanding of the physics of electronic correlation in real materials. The algorithms are intrinsically parallel, and currently available high-performance computers allow applications to systems containing a thousand or more electrons. With these tools one can study complicated problems such as the properties of surfaces and defects, while including electron correlation effects with high precision.

It has proved itself among the most accurate methods available for calculating many-electron ground states, and is one of the few approaches that can be applied to systems large enough to act as realistic models of solids. In attempts to use fixed-node DMC for excited-state calculations, it has often been assumed that the DMC energy must be greater than or equal to the energy of the lowest exact eigenfunction with the same symmetry as the trial function. We show that this assumption is not justified unless the trial function transforms according to a one-dimensional irreducible representation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. If the trial function transforms according to a multidimensional irreducible representation, corresponding to a degenerate energy level, the DMC energy may lie below the energy of the lowest eigenstate of that symmetry. Weaker variational bounds may then be obtained by choosing trial functions transforming according to one-dimensional irreducible representations of subgroups of the full symmetry group.},

This is particularly important for electrostatic interactions between charged defects, which decay only very slowly (asymptotically like L-1) with increasing supercell lattice constant L.

First-principles calculations have emerged as a powerful approach that complements experiments and can serve as a predictive tool in the identification and characterization of defects. The theoretical modeling of point defects in crystalline materials by means of electronic-structure calculations, with an emphasis on approaches based on density functional theory (DFT), is reviewed. A general thermodynamic formalism is laid down to investigate the physical properties of point defects independent of the materials class (semiconductors, insulators, and metals), indicating how the relevant thermodynamic quantities, such as formation energy, entropy, and excess volume, can be obtained from electronic structure calculations. Practical aspects such as the supercell approach and efficient strategies to extrapolate to the isolated-defect or dilute limit are discussed. Recent advances in tractable approximations to the exchange-correlation functional (DFT+U, hybrid functionals) and approaches beyond DFT are highlighted. These advances have largely removed the long-standing uncertainty of defect formation energies in semiconductors and insulators due to the failure of standard DFT to reproduce band gaps. Two case studies illustrate how such calculations provide new insight into the physics and role of point defects in real materials.},

Based on model calculations we determine an electronic ground state which gives g values compatible with the experimentally observed ordered moment and the paramagnetic susceptibility. The heat capacity of LaTiO3 is compared with that of orbitally ordered LaMnO3. We conclude that most of the low-temperature heat capacity arises from magnon contributions in both LaMnO3 and LaTiO3.},

In the homophilic regime, chains aggregate into tangled domains resulting in a relatively high percolation threshold, a high density of configurational trap states, and slow, dispersive charge transport. In the heterophilic regime at the same polymer volume fraction, chains self-organize into a lacework pattern resulting in a low percolation threshold and efficient, trap-free charge transport. For homophilic morphologies interchain hopping is rate-limiting and mobility is insensitive to chain length, whereas for heterophilic morphologies intrachain transport is important and mobility increases with increasing chain length. The morphologies are used in simulations of photocurrent quantum efficiency for donoracceptor blend photodiodes, which show that the effects of morphology on charge pair generation and recombination compete with the effect on transport, such that the optimum blend composition is sensitive to both morphology and recombination rate. We conclude that it is essential to consider the connectivity of and morphology adopted by polymer chains in the optimization of materials for organic solar cells.},

These two structures are related via an identical elementary subcell consisting of a tetrahedral-site and a pyramidal-site M-atom pair. This investigation shows that solid solutions between two hexagonal end members, such as Fe2P or Ni2P with Mn2P, may exhibit orthorhombic structures at intermediate compositions. Fe2P shows complete solid solubility with Ni2P. Curiously, hexagonal and orthorhombic symmetries alternate with decreasing number of 3d electrons, Ni2P(hex) -Co2P(ortho) -Fe2P(hex) -FeMnP(ortho) -Mn2P(hex). Lattice parameter variations with composition and M\"ossbauer studies reveal atomic ordering in the mixed systems, Mn and Cr substituting for pyramidal-site iron in FeMnP and FeCrP while Ni and Co substitute preferentially for tetrahedralsite iron in FeCoP and FeNiP. While neither Co2P nor Mn2P are ferromagnetic, intermediate phases are, the Curie temperature and magnetization reaching the maximum values 310\textdegree C and 3.03 {$\mu$}B/molecule for MnCoP. Metamagnetism appears for a range of compositions about (Mn0.7Co0.3)2P. The Co2P-Fe2P system is also ferromagnetic with a maximum Curie temperature near FeCoP. This system shows a sharp discontinuity in magnetization, but only a small discontinuity in Curie temperature, across the phase transition. Sensitivity to stoichiometry in the magnetization of Fe2-{$\epsilon$}P is attributed to an electron/atom ratio near that for the appearance of metamagnetism.},

Highly c-axis oriented films can be stabilized on SrTiO3, LaAlO3, (LaAlO3)0.3(Sr2AlTaO6)0.7, and NdGaO3 single crystalline substrates. However, the interface region between film and substrate is often found to be strongly defective. CaCuO2 films grown on (001)- and (110)-oriented NdGaO3 show the best crystallinity with lattice parameters nearly the same as for bulk CaCuO2 and a mosaic spread of about 0.1\textdegree. Regions where the interfacial growth is nearly perfect, dominantly show an A-site termination of NdGaO3, i.e., a layer stacking sequence of GaO2/NdO/CuO2/Ca. Resistivity measurements on the films show thermally activated behavior between 300\,K and 170\,K, i.e., ln R\,{$\sim$}\,TA/T, where the activation temperature TA amounts to 116\,K, and Mott variable range hopping, i.e., ln R\,{$\sim$}\,T-1/4, below about 120\,K. With decreasing film thickness, the resistivity increases remarkably, indicating that the interfacial conductivity is more insulating than metallic in character as expected from hole-doping of CaCuO2 due to apical oxygen at the NdO/CuO2 interface. Measurements of the magnetization do not show any indications for two-dimensional superconductivity at the interface. The experimental results suggest that the conductivity is rather caused by particulates of cupric oxide found in a distance of about 10\,nm from the interface in the upper part of the film.},

The nature of its ground state remains a matter of active debate. We conducted oxygen-17 single-crystal nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of the spin-1/2 kagome lattice in herbertsmithite [ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2], which is known to exhibit a spinon continuum in the spin excitation spectrum. We demonstrated that the intrinsic local spin susceptibility {$\chi$}kagome, deduced from the oxygen-17 NMR frequency shift, asymptotes to zero below temperatures of 0.03J, where J \textasciitilde{} 200 kelvin is the copper-copper superexchange interaction. Combined with the magnetic field dependence of {$\chi$}kagome that we observed at low temperatures, these results imply that the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet has a spin-liquid ground state with a finite gap. Peeking into an exotic magnetic structure Cooling materials that contain magnetic interactions generally leads to an ordered magnetic state. In materials known as quantum spin liquids (QSLs), the geometry of the crystal lattice may prevent this ordered state from forming, even at absolute zero. The material herbertsmithite is thought to be a strong candidate for a QSL, but the nature of its ground state is still a mystery. Fu et al. measured shifts in the nuclear magnetic resonance signals of herbertsmithite to conclude that its ground state has a zero spin and is separated from the first excited state by an energy gap (see the Perspective by Furukawa). The results suggest that herbertsmithite is indeed a QSL. Science, this issue p. 655; see also p. 631},

In fact, two apparently distinct forms of electronic symmetry breaking, one of intra-unit-cell rotational symmetry (Q=0 nematic) and the other of lattice translational symmetry (Q\$\textbackslash neq\$0 density wave), are reported extensively. However, indications of linkage between these two phenomena suggest the prospect of a unified fundamental description, with one intriguing possibility being an intra-unit-cell nematic density wave. Here we carry out site-specific measurements within each CuO\$\_2\$ unit-cell, segregating the results into three separate electronic structure images containing only the Cu sites (Cu(r)) and only the x/y-axis O sites (O\$\_x\$(r) and O\$\_y\$(r)). Phase resolved Fourier analysis reveals directly that the incommensurate modulations in the O\$\_x\$(r) and O\$\_y\$(r) sublattice images consistently exhibit a relative phase of \$\{\textbackslash pi\}\$. We confirm this discovery on two highly distinct cuprate compounds, ruling out tunnel matrix-element and materials specific systematics. These observations demonstrate by direct sublattice phase-resolved visualization that the cuprate density wave consists essentially of spatial modulations of the intra-unit-cell nematicity; this state can equally well be described as an intra-unit-cell density wave with a d-symmetry form factor.},

While the spin excitations appear anomalous in comparison with simple model systems, there is clear consistency among a variety of cuprate families. Focusing initially on hole-doped systems, we review the nature of the magnetic spectrum, and variations in magnetic spectral weight with doping. We consider connections with the phenomena of charge and spin stripe order, and the potential generality of such correlations as suggested by studies of magnetic-field and impurity induced order. We contrast the behavior of the hole-doped systems with the trends found in the electron-doped superconductors. Returning to hole-doped cuprates, studies of translation-symmetry-preserving magnetic order are discussed, along with efforts to explore new systems. We conclude with a discussion of future challenges.},

  abstract = {The existence of electronic symmetry breaking in the underdoped cuprates and its disappearance with increased hole density p are now widely reported. However, the relation between this transition and the momentum-space electronic structure underpinning the superconductivity has not yet been established. Here, we visualize the (intra\textendash unit-cell) and (density-wave) broken-symmetry states, simultaneously with the coherent topology, for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{$\delta$} samples spanning the phase diagram 0.06 {$\leq$} p {$\leq$} 0.23. We show that the electronic symmetry-breaking tendencies weaken with increasing p and disappear close to a critical doping pc = 0.19. Concomitantly, the coherent topology undergoes an abrupt transition, from arcs to closed contours, at the same pc. These data reveal that the topology transformation in cuprates is linked intimately with the disappearance of the electronic symmetry breaking at a concealed critical point. Under the Dome The superconducting transition temperature Tc of copper oxides has a dome-shaped dependence on chemical doping. Whether there is a quantum critical point (QCP) beneath the dome, and whether it is related to the enigmatic pseudogap, has been heavily debated. Two papers address this question in two different families of Bi-based cuprates. In (Bi,Pb)2(Sr,La)2CuO6+{$\delta$}, He et al. (p. 608) found that the Fermi surface (FS) undergoes a topological change as doping is increased, which points to the existence of a QCP at a doping close to the maximum in Tc, seemingly uncorrelated with the pseudogap. Fujita et al. (p. 612) studied a range of dopings in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{$\delta$} to find an FS reconstruction simultaneous with the disappearance of both rotational and translational symmetry breaking, the latter of which has been associated with the pseudogap. These findings point to a concealed QCP.},

  abstract = {The energy difference between the high spin and the low spin state of the model compound [Fe(NCH)6]2+ is investigated by means of Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), where special attention is dedicated to analyzing the effect of the fix node approximation on the accuracy of the results. For this purpose, we compare several Slater\textendash Jastrow and multireference Slater\textendash Jastrow trial wave functions. We found that a Slater\textendash Jastrow trial wave function constructed with the generalized Kohn\textendash Sham orbitals from hybrid DFT represents the optimal choice. This is understood by observing that hybrid functionals account for the subtle balance between exchange and correlation effects and the respective orbitals accurately describe the ligand\textendash metal hybridization as well as the charge reorganization accompanying the spin transition. Finally the DMC results are compared with those obtained by Hartree\textendash Fock, DFT, CASSCF, and CASPT2. While there is no clear reference value for the high spin\textendash low spin energy difference, DMC and high level CCSD(T) calculations agree within around 0.3 eV.},

  abstract = {We investigate the performance of contemporary semilocal and hybrid density functionals for bond energetics, structures, dipole moments, and harmonic frequencies of 3 d transition-metal (TM) compounds by comparison with gas-phase experiments. Special attention is given to the nonempirical metageneralized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) of Tao, Perdew, Staroverov, and Scuseria (TPSS) [Phys. Rev. Lett.91, 146401 (2003)], which has been implemented in TURBOMOLE for the present work. Trends and error patterns for classes of homologous compounds are analyzed, including dimers, monohydrides, mononitrides, monoxides, monofluorides, polyatomic oxides and halogenides, carbonyls, and complexes with organic {$\pi$} ligands such as benzene and cyclopentadienyl. Weakly bound systems such as Ca 2 , Mn 2 , and Zn 2 are discussed. We propose a reference set of reactionenergies for benchmark purposes. Our all-electron results with quadruple zeta valence basis sets validate semilocal density-functional theory as the workhorse of computational TM chemistry. Typical errors in bondenergies are substantially larger than in (organic) main group chemistry, however. The Becke-Perdew'86 [Phys. Rev. A38, 3098 (1988); Phys. Rev. B33, 8822 (1986)] GGA and the TPSS meta-GGA have the best price/performance ratio, while the TPSS hybrid functional achieves a slightly lower mean absolute error in bondenergies. The popular Becke three-parameter hybrid B3LYP underbinds significantly and tends to overestimate bond distances; we give a possible explanation for this. We further show that hybrid mixing does not reduce the width of the error distribution on our reference set. The error of a functional for the s - d transfer energy of a TM atom does not predict its error for TM bondenergies and bond lengths. For semilocal functionals, self-interaction error in one- and three-electron bonds appears to be a major source of error in TM reactionenergies. Nevertheless, TPSS predicts the correct ground-state symmetry in the vast majority of cases and rarely fails qualitatively. This further confirms TPSS as a general purpose functional that works throughout the periodic table. We also give workstation timing comparisons for the 645-atom protein crambin.},

We find that the Drude weight D is unexpectedly negative for half-filled Hubbard rings with N=4n sites reflecting a strong paramagnetic response, while it is positive (diamagnetic) for half-filled rings of N=4n+2 sites. In both cases at half filling, D vanishes exponentially with N on a length scale set by the inverse of the gap for small U/t. Near half filling, we find that D approaches a constant, positive, diamagnetic value as N increases, indicating metallic behavior. Combining Bethe-ansatz results near half filling with the known U=0 and U={$\infty$} limits and Lanczos finite-size extrapolations, we obtain a general picture of D in the thermodynamic limit as a function of band filling and the ratio U/t. We note similarities with the low-frequency integrated spectral weight of certain hole-doped and electron-doped high-Tc compounds. We investigate the finite-frequency optical conductivity, finding structure at {$\omega\approxeq$}U and, for one hole off half filling, at {$\omega\propto$}t2/U. We find that minima in the energy of a Hubbard ring enclosing a flux {$\Phi$} occur with changes of half a flux quantum rather than a full flux quantum when the Coulomb repulsion is turned on. Lastly, we discuss the relationship of the Drude weight computed from open chains to that obtained from rings, and also the effect of arbitrary phases at the ring boundary.},

In order to calculate the dielectric function, first, using hybrid density functional wavefunctions we have added GW corrections on top of the hybrid density functional calculations and we solved the so-called Bethe Salpeter equation to include effects of correlations of the electron-hole pair created upon photon absorption. We find that the effects of electron correlations are very important and they show up as a strong contribution of the electron-hole interaction in calculating the effects of the Bethe-Salpeter equation in the electron/hole pair excitation on top of the interacting group state.},

This follow-up to our previous study[1] was carried out with two times better momentum resolution, five times better energy resolution, and improved techniques for reducing experimental background. We compare our results to RPA calculations and evaluate the relative importance of interlayer hopping, excitonic corrections, and screening from higher energy excitations. We find that the static, limiting value of \$\textbackslash alpha\^\textbackslash ast\$ falls in the range 0.25 to 0.35, which is higher than our previous result of 0.14[1], but still below the value expected from RPA. Graphitic effects from interlayer hopping were found to play a negligible role in the range of momenta studied. Instead, the anomalous screening was found to arise from a combination of excitonic effects in the \$\textbackslash pi \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash pi\^\textbackslash ast\$ continuum and screening from the tightly bound \$\textbackslash sigma\$-bands. Both effects appear to fade in the limit of low momentum, suggesting a recovery of RPA in the asymptotic limit, but should have significant influence on low-energy measurements on length scales less than a few nm, such as STM.},

  abstract = {Metal hydrides are likely candidates for the solid state storage of hydrogen. NaAlH4 is the only complex metal hydride identified so far that combines favorable thermodynamics with a reasonable hydrogen storage capacity (5.5 wt \%) when decomposing in two steps to NaH, Al, and H2. The slow kinetics and poor reversibility of the hydrogen desorption can be combatted by the addition of a Ti-based catalyst. In an alternative approach we studied the influence of a reduced NaAlH4 particle size and the presence of a carbon support. We focused on NaAlH4/porous carbon nanocomposites prepared by melt infiltration. The NaAlH4 was confined in the mainly 2-3 nm pores of the carbon, resulting in a lack of long-range order in the NaAlH4 structure. The hydrogen release profile was modified by contact with the carbon; even for {$\sim$}10 nm NaAlH4 on a nonporous carbon material the decomposition of NaAlH4 to NaH, Al, and H2 now led to hydrogen release in a single step. This was a kinetic effect, with the temperature at which the hydrogen was released depending on the NaAlH4 feature size. However, confinement in a nanoporous carbon material was essential to not only achieve low H2 release temperatures, but also rehydrogenation at mild conditions (e.g., 24 bar H2 at 150 \textdegree C). Not only had the kinetics of hydrogen sorption improved, but the thermodynamics had also changed. When hydrogenating at conditions at which Na3AlH6 would be expected to be the stable phase (e.g., 40 bar H2 at 160 \textdegree C), instead nanoconfined NaAlH4 was formed, indicating a shift of the NaAlH4{$\leftrightarrow$}Na3AlH6 thermodynamic equilibrium in these nanocomposites compared to bulk materials.},

By describing the many-body system in terms of a single collective field we provide an alternative to traditional approaches, which emphasize one-particle orbitals. We refer to our approach as continuum mechanics for quantum many-body systems. In the linear response regime, the equation of motion for the displacement field becomes a linear fourth-order integrodifferential equation, whose only inputs are the one-particle density matrix and the pair-correlation function of the ground state. The complexity of this equation remains essentially unchanged as the number of particles increases. We show that our equation of motion is a Hermitian eigenvalue problem, which admits a complete set of orthonormal eigenfunctions under a scalar product that involves the ground-state density. Further, we show that the excitation energies derived from this approach satisfy a sum rule which guarantees the exactness of the integrated spectral strength. Our formulation becomes exact for systems consisting of a single particle and for any many-body system in the high-frequency limit. The theory is illustrated by explicit calculations for simple one- and two-particle systems.},

A sharp drop in resistance by about 3 orders of magnitude has been observed at {$\sim$}240 GPa with a concomitant change of the resistance type from semiconducting to metallic. This is the first experimental observation of an insulator-metal transition in NiO, which was anticipated by Mott decades ago. From simple multielectron consideration, the metallic phase of NiO forms when the effective Hubbard energy Ueff is almost equal to the estimated full bandwidth 2W.},

This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.},

Our method is a hybrid approach based on Chebyshev\textendash Jackson approximation theory and matrix purification methods like the second order spectral projection purification (SP2). Recent methods to compute the density matrix scale as O(N) in the number of floating point operations but are accompanied by large memory and communication overhead, and they are based on iterative use of the sparse matrix\textendash matrix multiplication kernel (SpGEMM), which is known to be computationally irregular. In addition to irregularity in the sparse Hamiltonian H, the nonzero structure of intermediate estimates of P depends on products of H and evolves over the course of computation. On the other hand, an expansion of the density matrix P in terms of Chebyshev polynomials is straightforward and SpMV based; however, the resulting density matrix may not satisfy the required constraints exactly. In this paper, we analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the Chebyshev\textendash Jackson polynomials and the second order spectral projection purification (SP2) method, and propose to combine them so that the accurate density matrix can be computed using the SpMV computational kernel only, and without having to store the density matrix P. Our method accomplishes these objectives by using the Chebyshev polynomial estimate as the initial guess for SP2, which is followed by using sparse matrix\textendash vector multiplications (SpMVs) to replicate the behavior of the SP2 algorithm for purification. We demonstrate the method on a tight-binding model system of an oxide material containing more than 3 million atoms. In addition, we also present the predicted behavior of our method when applied to near-metallic Hamiltonians with a wide energy spectrum.},

We use the many-body decomposition of the total energy to classify the errors of DMC and DFT into 1-body, 2-body and beyond-2-body components. Using both equilibrium cluster configurations and thermal ensembles of configurations, we find DMC to be uniformly much more accurate than DFT, partly because some of the approximate functionals give poor 1-body distortion energies. Even when these are corrected, DFT remains considerably less accurate than DMC. When both 1- and 2-body errors of DFT are corrected, some functionals compete in accuracy with DMC; however, other functionals remain worse, showing that they suffer from significant beyond-2-body errors. Combining the evidence presented here with the recently demonstrated high accuracy of DMC for ice structures, we suggest how DMC can now be used to provide benchmarks for larger clusters and for bulk liquid water.},

The benchmarks for each type of cluster are computed for a set of geometries drawn from molecular dynamics simulations. The accuracy of QMC is expected to be comparable with that of coupled-cluster calculations, and this is confirmed by comparisons for the CH4-H2O dimer. The benchmarks are used to assess the accuracy of the second-order M\o ller-Plesset (MP2) approximation close to the complete basis-set limit. A recently developed embedded many-body technique is shown to give an efficient procedure for computing basis-set converged MP2 energies for the large clusters. It is found that MP2 values for the methane binding energies and the cohesive energies of the water clusters without methane are in close agreement with the QMC benchmarks, but the agreement is aided by partial cancelation between 2-body and beyond-2-body errors of MP2. The embedding approach allows MP2 to be applied without loss of accuracy to the methane hydrate crystal, and it is shown that the resulting methane binding energy and the cohesive energy of the water lattice agree almost exactly with recently reported QMC values.},

We describe a strategy for achieving this, which exploits the fact that the HF energy of crystals can now be calculated using pseudopotentials and plane-wave basis sets, an approach that permits basis-set convergence to arbitrary precision. The errors due to the use of pseudopotentials are then computed from the difference of all-electron and pseudopotential total energies of atomic clusters, extrapolated to the bulk-crystal limit. The strategy is tested for the case of the LiH crystal, and it is shown that the HF cohesive energy can be converged with respect to all technical parameters to a precision approaching 0.1 mEh per atom. This cohesive energy and the resulting HF value of the equilibrium lattice parameter are compared with literature values obtained using Gaussian basis sets. \textcopyright{} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The term ``high-temperature superconductors'' is applied to those superconductors for which the critical temperature Tc exceeds 30\textendash 40 K and, what is especially important, is higher than the boiling point of nitrogen under the normal pressure. The discovery of HTS produced an exceptional interest and attracted intense attention in the scientific community and the public. This discovery is unquestionably highly important for physics and for solid-state physic specifically. The chapter shows how the critical temperature Tc was raised over the years up to 1973. An essential difference between superconductivity and superfluidity is the occurrence of the Meissner effect in superconductors that was discovered in 1933. A similarity can be found between the effect of rotation on the helium II and the effect of the external magnetic field on a superconductor but it is a different matter. The significant aspect is that superconductivity does not reduce to infinite conductivity and at equilibrium the external magnetic field cannot penetrate into the interior of a superconductor.},

We show the importance of this correction by studying potassium-doped picene (K\$\_3\$Picene), recently claimed to be a superconductor with a \$T\_c\$ of up to 18 K. The Hamiltonian parameters are derived from ab-initio density functional theory, and the lattice model is solved by dynamical mean-field theory. Our calculations include the effects of electron-electron interactions and local electron-phonon couplings. Even with the inclusion of a strongly coupled molecular phonon, the Hubbard repulsion prevails and the system is an insulator with a small Mott gap of \$\textbackslash approx\$ 0.2 eV.},

  abstract = {Despite over two decades of intense research efforts, the origin of high-temperature superconductivity in the copper oxides remains elusive. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments have revealed a kink in the dispersion relations (energy versus wavevector) of electronic states in the copper oxides at binding energies of 50-80 meV, raising the hope that this anomaly could be a key to understanding high-temperature superconductivity. The kink is often interpreted in terms of interactions between the electrons and a bosonic field. Although there is no consensus on the nature of the bosons (or even whether a boson model is appropriate), both phonons and spin fluctuations have been proposed as possible candidates. Here we report first-principles calculations of the role of phonons and the electron\textendash phonon interaction in the photoemission spectra of La2 - xSrxCuO4. Our calculations within the standard formalism demonstrate that the phonon-induced renormalization of the electron energies and the Fermi velocity is almost one order of magnitude smaller than the effect observed in photoemission experiments. Therefore, our result rules out electron\textendash phonon interaction in bulk La2 - xSrxCuO4 as the exclusive origin of the measured kink. Our conclusions are consistent with those reached independently in a recent study of the related compound YBa2Cu3O7.},

Nevertheless, bulk FeSe itself remains an unusual case when compared with pnictogen-based iron superconductors, and may hold clues to understanding the more exotic derivatives of the FeSe system. The FeSe phase diagram is distinct from the pnictides: the orthorhombic distortion, which is likely to be of a `spin-nematic' nature in numerous pnictides, is not accompanied by magnetic order in FeSe, and the superconducting transition temperature Tc rises significantly with pressure before decreasing. Here we show that the magnetic interactions in FeSe, as opposed to most pnictides, demonstrate an unusual and unanticipated frustration, which suppresses magnetic (but not nematic) order, triggers ferro-orbital order in the nematic phase and can naturally explain the non-monotonic pressure dependence of the superconducting critical temperature Tc(P).},

On the other hand, a collective-electron antiferromagnet having a half-filled band that is split in two by the magnetic ordering would have a kTN that decreased with increasing bandwidth, and hence increasing {$\Delta$}. This provides a criterion for distinguishing the two cases: dTNdp{$>$}0 for localized-electron antiferromagnetism and dTNdp{$<$}0 for collective-electron antiferromagnetism, where p is the hydrostatic pressure. It is therefore surprising that dTnda0{$>$}0, where a0 is the cation-anion-cation separation, in the systems Ca1-xSrxMnO3, A3+FeO3, and A3+CrO3, since independent data indicate that the d electrons are localized. This fact is attributed to changes in A-O covalent bonding that cause {$\Delta$} to increase with the more basic A cation for a given lattice parameter. The relatively small changes in TN with z in the series CaMnO3, Ca4Mn3O10, Ca3Mn2O7, and Ca2MnO4, where geometric considerations alone determine the relative magnitudes of {$\Delta$}, are shown to be consistent with dTNda0{$<$}0. However, it is pointed out that the magnitude of this geometrical contribution, which should approach a maximum at the localized-electron {$\rightleftarrows$}collective-electron transition, suggests there may be a change from localized d electrons in CaMnO3, to collective d electrons in Ca2MnO4. The fact that the paramagnetic susceptibility obeys a Curie-Weiss law in CaMnO3, but appears to be temperature-independent in Ca2MnO4, supports this view.},

LaTiO3 (TN = 125 K) is a type G antiferromagnet with a moment on Ti (III) of 0.45(5){$\mu$}B at 10 K. As bulk magnetic measurements indicate a weak ferromagnetic moment, a GzFx or GxFz configuration is implied. CeTiO3 (TN) = 116 K) shows more complex behaviour. At 81 K only G and F type reflections are observed. The most consistent interpretation is to assign G-type configuration to Ti(III) and an induced Fz on Ce(III). Moments are 0.36{$\mu$}B on Ti(III) and 0.4(1){$\mu$}B on Ce(III). It is also possible to assign both G and F components to Ti(III). This demands a ``canting angle'' of 34\textdegree{} to explain the F moment. Below 80 K a C-type component develops. A model assuming a GzFx configuration for Ti(III) and a CyFx configuration for Ce(III) provides a good fit to the data. This assignment is consistent with Bertaut's symmetry considerations.

  abstract = {Heavy-fermion systems represent a prototypical setting to study magnetic quantum phase transitions. A particular focus has been on the physics of Kondo destruction, which captures quantum criticality beyond the Landau framework of order-parameter fluctuations. In this context, we study the spin one-half Kondo-Heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice at half filling. The problem is approached from the Kondo-destroyed, antiferromagnetically ordered insulating phase. We describe the local moments in terms of a coarse grained quantum nonlinear sigma model, and show that the skyrmion defects of the antiferromagnetic order parameter host a number of competing order parameters. In addition to the spin Peierls, charge and current density wave order parameters, we identify for the first time Kondo singlets as the competing orders of the antiferromagnetism. We show that the antiferromagnetism and various competing singlet orders can be related to each other via generalized chiral transformations of the underlying fermions. We also show that the conduction electrons acquire a Berry phase through their coupling to the hedgehog configurations of the N\'eel order, which cancels the Berry phase of the local moments. Our results demonstrate the competition between the Kondo singlet formation and spin-Peierls order when the antiferromagnetic order is suppressed, thereby shedding new light on the global phase diagram of heavy-fermion systems at zero temperature.},

The temperature-dependent rate constants were determined by measuring the isothermal hydrogen evolution between 60 \textdegree C and 140 \textdegree C. Fractional decomposition curves showed good fits using both the second and third-order Avrami-Erofeyev equations, indicating that the decomposition kinetics are controlled by nucleation and growth of the aluminum phase in two and three dimensions. The large activation energies measured for the AlH3 polymorphs suggest that the decomposition occurs via an activated complex mechanism with complexes consisting of approximately nine AlH3 molecules (1-2 unit cells for {$\alpha$}-AlH3).},

As we follow the dispersing peak of the spectral function from the Fermi energy to the valence band complex, we find dispersion anomalies marked by two distinctive high energy scales, E1{$\approx$}0.38 eV and E2{$\approx$}0.8 eV. E1 marks the energy above which the dispersion splits into two branches. One is a continuation of the near parabolic dispersion, albeit with reduced spectral weight, and reaches the bottom of the band at the {$\Gamma$} point at {$\approx$}0.5 eV. The other is given by a peak in the momentum space, nearly independent of energy between E1 and E2. Above E2, a bandlike dispersion reemerges. We conjecture that these two energies mark the disintegration of the low-energy quasiparticles into a spinon and holon branch in the high Tc cuprates.},

The model has been remarkably successful at addressing a range of correlation phenomena in solids, but it neglects many behaviors that occur in real materials, such as phonons, long-range interactions, and, in its simplest form, multiorbital effects. Here, we use ab initio electronic structure methods to design a material whose Hamiltonian matches as closely as possible that of the single-band Hubbard model. Our motivation is to compare the measured properties of our new material to those predicted by reliable theoretical solutions of the Hubbard model to determine the relevance of the model in the description of real materials. After identifying an appropriate crystal class and several appropriate chemistries, we use density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to screen for the desired electronic band structure and metal-insulator transition. We then explore the most promising candidates for structural stability and suitability for doping, and we propose specific materials for subsequent synthesis. Finally, we identify a regime\textemdash that should manifest in our bespoke material\textemdash in which the single-band Hubbard model on a triangular lattice exhibits exotic d-wave superconductivity.},

This continuous evolution of the QMC electrons results in highly accurate total energies for the full dynamical trajectory at a fraction of the cost of conventional, discrete sampling. We show that this can be achieved efficiently for both ground and excited states with only a modest overhead to an ab initio MD method.

  abstract = {We present a comparative study of the geometry optimization in the gas phase of acrolein, acetone, methylenecyclopropene, and the propenoic acid anion with special emphasis on their excited-state structures, using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), multireference perturbation theory (CASPT2 and NEVPT2), second-order approximate coupled cluster (CC2), and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We find that, for all molecules, the geometries optimized with QMC in its simplest variational (VMC) flavor are in very good agreement with the perturbation results both in the ground and the excited states of either n \textrightarrow{} {$\pi$}* or {$\pi$} \textrightarrow{} {$\pi$}* character. Furthermore, the quality of the QMC structures is superior to those obtained with the CC2 method, which overestimates the CO bond in all n \textrightarrow{} {$\pi$}* excitations, or to the symmetry-adapted-cluster configuration interaction (SAC\textendash CI) approach, which gives a poorer description of the CC bonds in the excited states. Finally, the spread in the TDDFT structures obtained with several current exchange-correlation functionals is large and does not reveal a clear relation between the defining features of the functionals and the quality of the optimized structures. In summary, our findings demonstrate the good performance of QMC in optimizing the geometries of these molecules, also in cases where other correlated or TDDFT approaches are inaccurate, and indicate that the method represents a robust reference approach for future structural studies also of larger systems.},

We calculated the binding energy of a pair of holes for systems up to 6\texttimes 4 unit cells. We also studied the pairing correlation functions versus distance for both the d-wave and extended s-wave channels in systems up to 6\texttimes 6. We found that holes bind for a wide range of parameters and that the binding increased as the system size is increased. However, the pairing correlation functions decay quickly with distance. For the extended s channel, we found that as the Coulomb interaction Ud on the Cu sites is increased, the long-range part of the correlation functions is suppressed and fluctuates around zero. For the dx2-y2 channel, we found that the correlations decay rapidly with distance towards a small positive value. However, this value becomes smaller as the interaction Ud or the system size is increased.},

The high-purity absolute ground-state samples have up to 8000 molecules and densities of over 1011 cm-3. By measuring the Stark shifts induced by external electric fields, we determined the permanent electric dipole moment of the absolute ground-state 23Na87Rb and demonstrated the capability of inducing an effective dipole moment over 1 D. Bimolecular reaction between ground-state 23Na87Rb molecules is endothermic, but we still observed a rather fast decay of the molecular sample. Our results pave the way toward investigation of ultracold molecular collisions in a fully controlled manner and possibly to quantum gases of ultracold bosonic molecules with strong dipolar interactions.},

  abstract = {In conventional superconductors, the electron pairing that allows superconductivity is caused by exchange of virtual phonons, which are quanta of lattice vibration. For high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors, it is far from clear that phonons are involved in the pairing at all. For example, the negligible change in Tc of optimally doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ (Bi2212; ref. 1) upon oxygen isotope substitution (16O 18O leads to Tc decreasing from 92 to 91 K) has often been taken to mean that phonons play an insignificant role in this material. Here we provide a detailed comparison of the electron dynamics of Bi2212 samples containing different oxygen isotopes, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our data show definite and strong isotope effects. Surprisingly, the effects mainly appear in broad high-energy humps, commonly referred to as 'incoherent peaks'. As a function of temperature and electron momentum, the magnitude of the isotope effect closely correlates with the superconducting gap\textemdash that is, the pair binding energy. We suggest that these results can be explained in a dynamic spin-Peierls picture, where the singlet pairing of electrons and the electron\textendash lattice coupling mutually enhance each other.},

Particular stability was assigned to the experimentally detected species WSi12+, which has been shown by ab initio geometry optimization to adopt the shape of a regular hexagonal Si12 prism with the W atom in the center. A similar geometry\textemdash namely, a Si12 double-chair structure surrounding the metal atom impurity\textemdash has emerged from our extensive investigations of silicon clusters in combination with a Cu atom (CuSiN) as the likely ground-state structure of CuSi12. These results suggest the systematic importance of Si12 cages derived from regular structures with D6h geometry for the architecture of silicon clusters containing metal atom impurities. In the present comparative study, we discuss the salient features of endohedral MSi12 clusters with M=Cu, Mo, W, as well as several cationic and anionic species of these systems, with regard to their geometric and electronic structure. The interaction between the Si12 cage and the enclosed metal impurity is characterized as strongly delocalized bonding for M=Mo, W, while Cu tends to form directed bonds with selected atoms of the cage. Linear extension of the MSi12 (Me=Mo,W) cells along their principal axes leads to units of the form M2Si18.},

Familiar among these are the Mott insulator, high-transition-temperature superconductor and metallic phases. A fourth phase, of unknown identity, occurs at light doping along the zero-temperature bound of the 'pseudogap' regime. This regime is rich in peculiar electronic phenomena, prompting numerous proposals that it contains some form of hidden electronic order. Here we present low-temperature electronic structure imaging studies of a lightly hole-doped copper oxide: Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2. Tunnelling spectroscopy (at energies |E| {$>$} 100 meV) reveals electron extraction probabilities greatly exceeding those for injection, as anticipated for a doped Mott insulator. However, for |E| {$<$} 100 meV, the spectrum exhibits a V-shaped energy gap centred on E = 0. States within this gap undergo intense spatial modulations, with the spatial correlations of a four CuO2-unit-cell square 'checkerboard', independent of energy. Intricate atomic-scale electronic structure variations also exist within the checkerboard. These data are consistent with an unanticipated crystalline electronic state, possibly the hidden electronic order, existing in the zero-temperature pseudogap regime of Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2.},

The pseudopotential core includes 92 electrons corresponding to the configuration [Xe]4f\,145d105f\,14. The parameters for the elements 111\textendash 118 were fitted by two-component multi-configuration Hartree\textendash Fock calculations in the intermediate coupling scheme to the total energies of 267 up to 797 J levels arising from 31 up to 62 nonrelativistic configurations, including also anionic and highly ionized states, with mean absolute errors clearly below 0.02~eV for averages corresponding to nonrelativistic configurations. Primitive basis sets for one- and two-component pseudopotential calculations have been optimized for the ground and excited states and exhibit finite basis set errors with respect to the finite-difference Hartree\textendash Fock limit below 0.01 and 0.02~eV, respectively. General contraction schemes have been applied to obtain valence basis sets of polarized valence double- to quadruple-zeta quality. Results of atomic test calculations in the intermediate coupling scheme at the Fock-space coupled-cluster level are in good agreement with those of corresponding fully relativistic all-electron calculations based on the Dirac\textendash Coulomb\textendash Breit Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate besides the well-known need of a relativistic treatment at the Dirac\textendash Coulomb level also the necessity to include higher-order corrections for the superheavy elements.},

  abstract = {Logic circuits built using nanoscale technologies have significant reliability limitations due to fundamental physical and manufacturing constraints of their constituent devices. This paper presents a probabilistic gate model (PGM), which relates the output probability to the error and input probabilities of an unreliable logic gate. The PGM is used to obtain computational algorithms, one being approximate and the other accurate, for the evaluation of circuit reliability. The complexity of the approximate algorithm, which does not consider dependencies among signals, increases linearly with the number of gates in a circuit. The accurate algorithm, which accounts for signal dependencies due to reconvergent fanouts and/or correlated inputs, has a worst-case complexity that is exponential in the numbers of dependent reconvergent fanouts and correlated inputs. By leveraging the fact that many large circuits consist of common logic modules, a modular approach that hierarchically decomposes a circuit into smaller modules and subsequently applies the accurate PGM algorithm to each module, is further proposed. Simulation results are presented for applications on the LGSynth91 and ISCAS85 benchmark circuits. It is shown that the modular PGM approach provides highly accurate results with a moderate computational complexity. It can further be embedded into an early design flow and is scalable for use in the reliability evaluation of large circuits.},

But this approach is limited where large cells or searches over millions of structure types become necessary. To treat these with first-principles accuracy, one 'coarse-grains' the many-particle Schr\"odinger equation into 'model hamiltonians' whose variables are configurational order parameters (atomic positions, spin and so on), connected by a few 'interaction parameters' obtained from a microscopic theory. But to construct a truly quantitative model hamiltonian, one must know just which types of interaction parameters to use, from possibly 106\textendash 108 alternative selections. Here we show how genetic algorithms, mimicking biological evolution ('survival of the fittest'), can be used to distil reliable model hamiltonian parameters from a database of first-principles calculations. We demonstrate this for a classic dilemma in solid-state physics, structural inorganic chemistry and metallurgy: how to predict the stable crystal structure of a compound given only its composition. The selection of leading parameters based on a genetic algorithm is general and easily applied to construct any other type of complex model hamiltonian from direct quantum-mechanical results.},

  abstract = {The spectral energy gap is an important signature that defines states of quantum matter: insulators, density waves and superconductors have very different gap structures. The momentum-resolved nature of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) makes it a powerful tool to characterize spectral gaps. ARPES has been instrumental in establishing the anisotropic d-wave structure of the superconducting gap in high-transition-temperature (Tc) cuprates, which is different from the conventional isotropic s-wave superconducting gap. Shortly afterwards, ARPES demonstrated that an anomalous gap above Tc, often termed the pseudogap, follows a similar anisotropy. The nature of this poorly understood pseudogap and its relationship with superconductivity has since become the focal point of research in the field. To address this issue, the momentum, temperature, doping and materials dependence of spectral gaps have been extensively examined with significantly improved instrumentation and carefully matched experiments in recent years. This article overviews the current understanding and unresolved issues of the basic phenomenology of gap hierarchy. We show how ARPES has been sensitive to phase transitions, has distinguished between orders having distinct broken electronic symmetries, and has uncovered rich momentum- and temperature-dependent fingerprints reflecting an intertwined and competing relationship between the ordered states and superconductivity that results in multiple phenomenologically distinct ground states inside the superconducting dome. These results provide us with microscopic insights into the cuprate phase diagram.},

First is the enormous wealth of energy band calculations that have had tremendous success in explaining the properties of specific solids, but in which the connection with first principles is not always apparent. Second is the spectacular progress of many-body theory applied to the solid state that has given a number of new results, although often of a rather general and formal nature, such as to provide the justification and a formal basis for a one-electron theory. The electron gas problem is treated in some detail here. The problem of the crystal potential is given due attention. It discusses the potential from the ion cores as well as from the valence electrons, and suggests schemes that incorporate essential exchange and correlation effects for the valence electrons. An energy band calculation that properly includes the effects of exchange and correlation describes the elementary excitations called quasi particles. Quasi-particle properties are usually discussed using the remarkable Landau theory of the Fermi liquid. This chapter gives a brief presentation of the theory and reviews the present status of calculations of the Fermi liquid parameters and how they are determined from experiments.},

  abstract = {A set of successively more accurate self-consistent equations for the one-electron Green's function have been derived. They correspond to an expansion in a screened potential rather than the bare Coulomb potential. The first equation is adequate for many purposes. Each equation follows from the demand that a corresponding expression for the total energy be stationary with respect to variations in the Green's function. The main information to be obtained, besides the total energy, is one-particle-like excitation spectra, i.e., spectra characterized by the quantum numbers of a single particle. This includes the low-excitation spectra in metals as well as configurations in atoms, molecules, and solids with one electron outside or one electron missing from a closed-shell structure. In the latter cases we obtain an approximate description by a modified Hartree-Fock equation involving a "Coulomb hole" and a static screened potential in the exchange term. As an example, spectra of some atoms are discussed. To investigate the convergence of successive approximations for the Green's function, extensive calculations have been made for the electron gas at a range of metallic densities. The results are expressed in terms of quasiparticle energies E(k) and quasiparticle interactions f(k, k{${'}$}). The very first approximation gives a good value for the magnitude of E(k). To estimate the derivative of E(k) we need both the first- and the second-order terms. The derivative, and thus the specific heat, is found to differ from the free-particle value by only a few percent. Our correction to the specific heat keeps the same sign down to the lowest alkali-metal densities, and is smaller than those obtained recently by Silverstein and by Rice. Our results for the paramagnetic susceptibility are unreliable in the alkali-metal-density region owing to poor convergence of the expansion for f. Besides the proof of a modified Luttinger-Ward-Klein variational principle and a related self-consistency idea, there is not much new in principle in this paper. The emphasis is on the development of a numerically manageable approximation scheme.},

  abstract = {In high-temperature cuprate superconductors, it is now generally agreed that superconductivity is realized by doping an antiferromagnetic Mott (charge transfer) insulator. The doping-induced insulator-to-superconductor transition has been widely observed in cuprates, which provides important information for understanding the superconductivity mechanism. In the iron-based superconductors, however, the parent compound is mostly antiferromagnetic bad metal, raising a debate on whether an appropriate starting point should go with an itinerant picture or a localized picture. No evidence of doping-induced insulator\textendash superconductor transition (or crossover) has been reported in the iron-based compounds so far. Here, we report an electronic evidence of an insulator\textendash superconductor crossover observed in the single-layer FeSe film grown on a SrTiO3 substrate. By taking angle-resolved photoemission measurements on the electronic structure and energy gap, we have identified a clear evolution of an insulator to a superconductor with increasing carrier concentration. In particular, the insulator\textendash superconductor crossover in FeSe/SrTiO3 film exhibits similar behaviors to that observed in the cuprate superconductors. Our results suggest that the observed insulator\textendash superconductor crossover may be associated with the two-dimensionality that enhances electron localization or correlation. The reduced dimensionality and the interfacial effect provide a new pathway in searching for new phenomena and novel superconductors with a high transition temperature.},

  abstract = {The unclear relationship between cuprate superconductivity and the pseudogap state remains an impediment to understanding the high transition temperature (Tc) superconducting mechanism. Here, we used magnetic field\textendash dependent scanning tunneling microscopy to provide phase-sensitive proof that d-wave superconductivity coexists with the pseudogap on the antinodal Fermi surface of an overdoped cuprate. Furthermore, by tracking the hole-doping (p) dependence of the quasi-particle interference pattern within a single bismuth-based cuprate family, we observed a Fermi surface reconstruction slightly below optimal doping, indicating a zero-field quantum phase transition in notable proximity to the maximum superconducting Tc. Surprisingly, this major reorganization of the system's underlying electronic structure has no effect on the smoothly evolving pseudogap. Under the Dome The superconducting transition temperature Tc of copper oxides has a dome-shaped dependence on chemical doping. Whether there is a quantum critical point (QCP) beneath the dome, and whether it is related to the enigmatic pseudogap, has been heavily debated. Two papers address this question in two different families of Bi-based cuprates. In (Bi,Pb)2(Sr,La)2CuO6+{$\delta$}, He et al. (p. 608) found that the Fermi surface (FS) undergoes a topological change as doping is increased, which points to the existence of a QCP at a doping close to the maximum in Tc, seemingly uncorrelated with the pseudogap. Fujita et al. (p. 612) studied a range of dopings in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{$\delta$} to find an FS reconstruction simultaneous with the disappearance of both rotational and translational symmetry breaking, the latter of which has been associated with the pseudogap. These findings point to a concealed QCP.},

This degradation effect is associated with the relatively high diffusion coefficient of hydrogen and the changes in local bonding coordination promoted by hydrogen. Reviewed are the fundamental aspects of the interplay between hydrogen and electronic energy states that form the basis of competing microscopic models for explaining the degradation effect. These models are tested against the latest experimental observations, and material and preparation parameters that reduce the Staebler-Wronski effect are discussed.},

  abstract = {Derivation of low-energy effective models by a partial trace summation of the electronic degrees of freedom far away from the Fermi level, called downfolding, is reexamined. We propose an improved formalism free from the double counting of electron correlation in the low-energy degrees of freedom. In this approach, the exchange-correlation energy in the local-density approximation (LDA) is replaced with the GW self-energy; herewith its low-energy part associated with the double counting is subtracted. Moreover, in our formalism, the frequency dependence of the effective parameter is renormalized into the static one. We apply the formalism to SrVO3 as well as to two iron-based superconductors, FeSe and FeTe. The resultant bandwidths of the effective models are nearly the same as those of the previous downfolding formalism because of striking cancellations between an increase arising from the exclusion of the low-energy correlation and a shrinking arising from the renormalization of the frequency dependence. In the nondegenerate multiband materials such as FeSe and FeTe, the momentum dependent self-energy effects yield substantial modifications of the band structures and relative shifts of orbital-energy levels of the effective models, which may explain the stability of the bicollinear antiferromagnetic phase in FeTe as well as the experimental absence of the antiferromagnetic phase in FeSe.},

The resulting effective model can afterwards be solved by accurate many-body solvers. We improve this "multi-scale ab initio scheme for correlated electrons" (MACE) primarily in two directions: (1) Double counting of electronic correlations between the DFT and the low-energy solver is avoided by using the constrained GW scheme. (2) The frequency dependence of the interaction emerging from the partial trace summation is taken into account as a renormalization to the low-energy dispersion. The scheme is successfully tested on the example of SrVO3. Our work opens unexplored ways to understanding the electronic structure of strongly correlated systems beyond current DFT methods.},

Among them, magnetic materials for spintronic devices have been surveyed as the first exercise. In this roadmap exercise, we have targeted magnetic tunnel and spin-valve junctions as spintronic devices. These can be used, for example, as a cell for a magnetic random access memory and a spin-torque oscillator in their vertical form as well as a spin transistor and a spin Hall device in their lateral form. In these devices, the critical role of magnetic materials is to inject spin-polarized electrons efficiently into a nonmagnet. We have accordingly identified two key properties to be achieved by developing new magnetic materials for future spintronic devices: 1) half-metallicity at room temperature (RT) and 2) perpendicular anisotropy in nanoscale devices at RT. For the first property, five major magnetic materials are selected for their evaluation for future magnetic/spintronic device applications: 1) Heusler alloys; 2) ferrites; 3) rutiles; 4) perovskites; and 5) dilute magnetic semiconductors. These alloys have been reported or predicted to be half-metallic ferromagnets at RT. They possess a bandgap at the Fermi level EF only for its minority spins, achieving 100\% spin polarization at EF. We have also evaluated L10 alloys and D022-Mn alloys for the development of a perpendicularly anisotropic ferromagnet with large spin polarization. We have listed several key milestones for each material on their functionality improvements, property achievements, device implementations, and interdisciplinary applications within 35 years time scale.

Amorphizability of crystalline solids is shown to derive from topological properties of connectivity, and the defect structures of highly defective or amorphizing solids can be individually identified and categorized in model simulations using topological tools. Polyamorphic phase transformations between alternative amorphous arrangements can be similarly characterized.

Dirac materials are characterized by a linear dispersion for low-energy electronic excitations, with a small band gap of O(meV) if lattice symmetries are broken. Dark matter at the keV scale carrying kinetic energy as small as a few meV can scatter and excite an electron across the gap. Alternatively, bosonic dark matter as light as a few meV can be absorbed by the electrons in the target. We develop the formalism for dark matter scattering and absorption in Dirac materials and calculate the experimental reach of these target materials. We find that Dirac materials can play a crucial role in detecting dark matter in the keV to MeV mass range that scatters with electrons via a kinetically mixed dark photon, as the dark photon does not develop an in-medium effective mass. The same target materials provide excellent sensitivity to absorption of light bosonic dark matter in the meV to hundreds of meV mass range, superior to all other existing proposals when the dark matter is a kinetically mixed dark photon.},

We find that in a given reasoning episode ontologies can be dynamic in construction (referring to when the reasoner constructs the ontologies) or application (referring to which ontologies are applied in a given reasoning episode). In our data, we see instances of students flexibly switching back and forth between parallel stable structures as well as constructing and negotiating new ontologies in the moment. Methodologically, we use a collective conceptual blending framework as an analytic tool for capturing student reasoning in groups. In this research, we value the messiness of student reasoning and argue that reasoning in a tentative manner can be productive for students learning quantum mechanics. As such, we shift away from a binary view of student learning which sees students as either having the correct answer or not.},

  abstract = {Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas-phase reaction channels. This work considers N2 dissociation. The molecule is strongly bound and stretched geometries are chosen. Heterogeneous catalysis by copper is simulated. It was investigated in our previous work as it is in many ways a prototype metal presenting a close-packed surface here. These nitrogen molecules are adsorbed on copper and fixed geometries on the dissociation reaction pathway for stretched N2 are given using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in a plane-wave basis. This dissociating molecule appears to be underbound using the ab initio Perdew, Burke, Ernzerhof (PBE) DFT functional but while this phenomenon accounts for a few percent at 5 \AA, at 6 \AA, PBE gives less than 30\% of the binding energy. This indicates the onset of dissociation. The PBE wave-functions at these bond-lengths serve as trial input for Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations of the ground states to obtain highly accurate correlated results for the associated activation barriers indicating the catalytic effect on this dissociation. The geometries from this bond-stretching study mimic the transition state (TS). This procedure requires no search for the actual TS geometry. Finite-size effects and fixed-node error are possible limitations to accuracy of this type of QMC study. We are able to limit fixed-node error, using certain trial wave-functions. The finite-size effect is considerable, although comparing two adsorbed geometries cancels about 90\% with respect to clean surfaces. Unfolding the cell to simulate a 9 k-point grid (rather than a single k-point) reduces the remainder by at least a factor 130 but relations for calibrating the remaining (2 mHa) error on converged grids are also used. The pseudopotential used to represent the atomic core of copper must also be determined carefully: we leave 11 active electrons but include the 3d shell in the pseudopotential. \textcopyright{} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Long-range interactions are expected to play a role in honeycomb materials because the vanishing density of states in the semimetallic weak-coupling phase suppresses screening. According to our results, the Kane-Mele-Coulomb model supports the same phases as the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. The nonlocal part of the interaction promotes short-range sublattice charge fluctuations, which compete with antiferromagnetic order driven by the onsite repulsion. Consequently, the critical interaction for the magnetic transition is significantly larger than for the purely local Hubbard repulsion. Our numerical data are consistent with SU(2) Gross-Neveu universality for the semimetal to antiferromagnet transition, and with 3D XY universality for the quantum spin Hall to antiferromagnet transition.},

The algorithm efficiently samples states with probability approximately proportional to an arbitrary function of the second-quantized Hamiltonian matrix element connecting the sampled state to the current state. We apply the new sampling algorithm to the recently developed semistochastic full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo (S-FCIQMC) method, a semistochastic implementation of the power method for projecting out the ground state energy in a basis of Slater determinants. Our new sampling method requires modest additional computational time and memory compared to uniform sampling but results in newly spawned weights that are approximately of the same magnitude, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of projection. A comparison in efficiency between our sampling algorithm and uniform sampling is performed on the all-electron nitrogen dimer at equilibrium in Dunning's cc-pVXZ basis sets with X {$\in$} \{D, T, Q, 5\}, demonstrating a large gain in efficiency that increases with basis set size. In addition, a comparison in efficiency is performed on three all-electron first-row dimers, B2, N2, and F2, in a cc-pVQZ basis, demonstrating that the gain in efficiency compared to uniform sampling also increases dramatically with the number of electrons.},

Based on the generalized Feynman-Kacs formula, many-body perturbation theory, and band structure calculations, we analyze the use and the analytical form of the backflow function from different points of view. The resulting wave functions are used in variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the electron gas and of solid and liquid metallic hydrogen. For the electron gas, the purely analytic backflow and three-body form gives lower energies than those of previous calculations. For bcc hydrogen, analytical and optimized backflow-three-body wave functions lead to energies nearly as low as those from using local density approximation orbitals in the trial wave function. However, compared to wave functions constructed from density functional solutions, backflow wave functions have the advantage of only few parameters to estimate, the ability to include easily and accurately electron-electron correlations, and that they can be directly generalized from the crystal to a disordered liquid of protons.},

Using numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the full and downfolded model, we demonstrate that depending on filling, the effective interaction in the low-energy theory is either barely screened or antiscreened, in contrast to the cRPA prediction. This observation is explained by a functional renormalization group analysis, which shows that the cRPA contribution to the screening is to a large extent canceled by other diagrams in the direct particle-hole channel. We comment on the implications of this finding for the ab initio estimation of interaction parameters in low-energy descriptions of solids.},

We examined various single-determinant and multideterminant wavefunctions multiplied by a Jastrow factor as a trial/guiding wavefunction for VMC/DMC. The molecular orbitals in the single determinants were calculated using restricted or unrestricted Hartree\textendash Fock or density functional theory (DFT) calculations where five commonly used local (SVWN5), semilocal (PW91 and BLYP), and hybrid (B1LYP and B3LYP) functionals were examined. The multideterminant expansions were obtained from the generalized valence bond and (truncated) unrestricted configuration interaction with single and double excitations (UCISD) methods. We also examined a UCISD wavefunction in which UCISD expansions were added to the UB3LYP single-determinant reference, and their coefficients were optimized at the VMC level. In addition to the wavefunction dependence, the effects of pseudopotentials and backflow transformation were also investigated. The UB3LYP single-determinant and multideterminant wavefunctions were found to give the variationally best DMC energies within the framework of single-determinant and multideterminants, respectively, though both the DMC energies were higher than twice the DMC atomic energy. Some of the VMC binding curves show a flat or quite shallow well bottom, which gets recovered deeper by DMC. All the DMC binding curves have a minimum indicating a bound state, but the unrestricted ones overestimate the equilibrium bond length. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Self-interstitial formation energies have larger differences between DMC and DFT, of up to 0.33eV, at the tetrahedral site.

  abstract = {Fermiology, the shape and size of the Fermi surface, underpins the low-temperature physical properties of a metal. Recent investigations of the Fermi surface of high-Tc superconductors, however, show a most unusual behavior: upon addition of carriers, ``Fermi'' pockets appear around nodal (hole doping) and antinodal (electron doping) regions of the Brillouin zone in the ``pseudogap'' state. With progressive doping, {$\delta$}, these evolve into well-defined Fermi surfaces around optimal doping ({$\delta$}opt), with no pseudogap. Correspondingly, various physical responses, including d-wave superconductivity, evolve from highly anomalous up to {$\delta$}opt, to more conventional beyond. Describing this evolution holds the key to understanding high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we present ab initio quantum chemical results for cuprates, in an attempt to provide a quantitative description of the evolution of the Fermi surface with {$\delta$}. Our results constitute an ab initio justification for several hitherto proposed semiphenomenological theories, offering a unified basis for understanding of various unusual physical responses of cuprates.},

When moving through the antiferromagnetic background, the hole must bring along this spin-polarization cloud at nearby Cu sites, which gives rise to a substantial reduction of the effective hopping parameters. Such interactions can explain the relatively low values inferred for the effective hoppings by fitting the angle-resolved photoemission data. The effect of the background antiferromagnetic couplings of renormalizing the effective nearest-neighbor hopping is also confirmed by density-matrix renormalization-group model-Hamiltonian calculations for chains and ladders of CuO4 plaquettes.},

Here, we report the signatures of the edge superconductivity by superconducting quantum interference measurements in multilayer WTe2 Josephson junctions and we directly map the localized supercurrent. In thick WTe2 (\$\textbackslash sim 60\{\textbackslash rm\{\textbackslash{} nm\}\})\$, the supercurrent is uniformly distributed by bulk states with symmetric Josephson effect (\$| \{I\_c\^ + ( B )\} | \{=\} | \{I\_c\^ - ( B )\} |\textbackslash{} \$). In thin WTe2 (10 nm), however, the supercurrent becomes confined to the edge and its width reaches up to \$1.4\{\textbackslash rm\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash mu m\textbackslash{} \}\}\$and exhibits non-symmetric behavior \$| \{I\_c\^ + ( B )\} | \textbackslash ne | \{I\_c\^ - ( B )\} |\$. The ability to tune the edge domination by changing thickness and the edge superconductivity establishes WTe2 as a promising topological system with exotic quantum phases and a rich physics.},

As a function of distance, both the dx2-y2-wave and extended s-wave pairing correlations decayed quickly. In the charge-transfer regime, increasing Vpd decreased the long-range part of the correlation functions in both channels, while in the mixed-valent regime, it increased the long-range part of the s-wave behavior but decreased that of the d-wave behavior. Still the d-wave behavior dominated. At a given doping, increasing Vpd increased the spin-spin correlations in the charge-transfer regime but decreased them in the mixed-valent regime. Also, increasing Vpd suppressed the charge-charge correlations between neighboring Cu and O sites. Electron and hole doping away from half-filling was accompanied by a rapid suppression of antiferromagnetic correlations. Our results suggest that adding a repulsive Vpd to the model does not enhance its tendency toward superconductivity even though the behavior of the spin structure factor is consistent with the properties of some high-temperature superconducting materials.},

Combined with previous data around the so-called 1/8 doping, we show that bulk CDW order exists at least for hole concentrations (p) in the CuO2 planes of 0.078{$\lessequivlnt$}p{$\lessequivlnt$}0.132. This implies that CDW order exists in close vicinity to the quantum critical point for spin-density-wave (SDW) order. In contrast to the pseudogap temperature T{${_\ast}$}, the onset temperature of CDW order decreases with underdoping to TCDW{$\sim$}90 K in YBa2Cu3O6.44. Together with a weakened order parameter this suggests a competition between CDW and SDW orders. In addition, the CDW order in YBa2Cu3O6.44 shows the same type of competition with superconductivity as a function of temperature and magnetic field as samples closer to p=1/8. At low p the CDW incommensurability continues the previously reported linear increasing trend with underdoping. In the entire doping range the in-plane correlation length of the CDW order in b axis direction depends only very weakly on the hole concentration, and appears independent of the type and correlation length of the oxygen-chain order. The onset temperature of the CDW order is remarkably close to a temperature T\textdagger{} that marks the maximum of 1/(T1T) in planar Cu63 NQR/NMR experiments, potentially indicating a response of the spin dynamics to the formation of the CDW. Our discussion of these findings includes a detailed comparison to the charge stripe order in La2-xBaxCuO4.},

A variety of transition metal centers in various oxidation states and multiplicities along with a number of different coordinating ligands are considered. Environmental effects have been included to enable reasonable quantitative comparison with experiment. The manifold of states is studied using initial guesses constructed from ligand field theory. A localized orbital correction (LOC) model, referred to as DBLOC-DFT (d-block localized orbital corrected density functional theory), systematically corrects B3LYP calculations using five parameters. The final results are a considerable improvement over conventional DFT, bringing the mean unsigned error (MUE) from 10.14 kcal/mol with a standard deviation of 4.56 to 1.98 kcal/mol with a standard deviation of 1.62. Depending on the relative multiplicities of the ground and excited states, it is shown that B3LYP*, which has 15\% exact nonlocal exchange, can lead to larger errors with respect to experiment than B3LYP. Application to 7 complexes from Swart et al. [J. Phys. Chem.

With this goal in mind we introduce a new framework for engineering a 2D TI by hybridizing graphene with impurity bands arising from heavy adatoms possessing partially filled d-shells, in particular osmium and iridium. First principles calculations predict that the gaps generated by this means exceed 0.2 eV over a broad range of adatom coverage; moreover, tuning of the Fermi level is not required to enter the TI state. The mechanism at work is expected to be rather general and may open the door to designing new TI phases in many materials.},

All models are free of the fermion-sign problem allowing numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations to be performed to extremely low temperatures. We numerically compute the {$\mathbb{Z}$}2 invariant and spin Chern number C{$\sigma$} directly from the zero-frequency single-particle Green's functions, and study the topological phase transitions driven by the tight-binding parameters at different on-site interaction strengths. The {$\mathbb{Z}$}2 invariant and spin Chern number, which are complementary to each another, characterize the topological phases and identify the critical points of topological phase transitions. Although the numerically determined phase boundaries are nearly identical for different system sizes, we find strong system-size dependence of the spin Chern number, where quantized values are only expected upon approaching the thermodynamic limit. For the Hubbard models we considered, the QMC results show that correlation effects lead to shifts in the phase boundaries relative to those in the noninteracting limit, without any spontaneously symmetry breaking. The interaction-induced shift is nonperturbative in the interactions and cannot be captured within a ``simple'' self-consistent calculation either, such as Hartree-Fock. Furthermore, our QMC calculations suggest that quantum fluctuations from interactions stabilize topological phases in systems where the one-body terms preserve the D3 symmetry of the lattice, and destabilize topological phases when the one-body terms break the D3 symmetry.},

As found in LSCO, the T-linear component {$\alpha$}1(0) is finite for all superconducting samples, its magnitude scaling with the transition temperature Tc. By contrast, the T2 coefficient {$\alpha$}2(0) is essentially doping independent. Such an extended regime (in doping) of T-linear resistivity at low T is at odds with conventional quantum critical scenarios involving the collapse of an ordered phase, possibly associated with the normal state pseudogap, to 0 K at a critical doping level. Its confirmation in Tl2201, whose electronic state (as revealed by quantum oscillation experiments) is highly homogeneous over hundreds of unit cells, appears to rule out phase separation or electronic inhomogeneity as the origin of this extended critical behaviour.},

Variations in the local Cu d charges and in-plane O p charge are considered for the prototypical high-Tc parent oxide La2CuO4. To isolate the charge fluctuations, the calculations are done in a supercell of size up to 2\texttimes 2 in the basal plane. The local density-functional calculations are done using the linear muffin-tin orbital approach with the atomic sphere approximation. In the Hubbard Hamiltonian, the Cu d(x2-y2) and O p(x,y) orbitals are included in the pd{$\sigma$} configuration. The one-electron parameters consist of bare on-site energies ({$\varepsilon$}p,{$\varepsilon$}d) and first-neighbor hopping from Cu to O (tpd) and from O to O (tpp) while the Coulomb-interaction parameters include on-site (Ud,Up) and intersite (Upd,Upp) terms. Results of the present calculation indicate that La2CuO4 is intermediate between the extreme spin or charge fluctuation regimes. This places strong constraints on the available parameter space for theories of high-Tc superconductivity based on the extended Hubbard model.},

A model for understanding and interpreting those spectra is presented. The electronic structure of the active Cu-O planes is represented by an extended three-band Hubbard model whose parameters have been previously derived from quantum-chemical calculations. The essential additional Coulomb interaction between the core hole created in the absorption process and the nearby valence electrons has been included by calculating the necessary on-site and nearest-neighbor core-valence Coulomb parameters. The absorption spectra are calculated using exact-diagonalization techniques for finite clusters. The low-energy electronic structure can be represented within an effective one-band Hubbard model whose parameters are obtained by a mapping from the three-band model. The transition operator for the absorption process as well as the core-hole Coulomb potential are also mapped into the one-band model. The final calculations in the one-band model are performed for the insulator (half filling) and for several excess hole concentrations in the metal. The theoretical and experimental spectra are compared in detail. The calculations accurately account for the observed peak intensities as a function of doping. Important features include the gap between the preedge peaks in the metal, core-hole excitonic effects, and transfer of oscillator strength. In particular, the preedge peak separation is the charge-transfer gap (from the insulator) reduced by the core-hole exciton binding energy. The transfer of oscillator strength between the observed peaks, which is a key signature of the correlated band situation, is analyzed in detail. A doped charge-transfer insulator model for the electronic structure of the cuprates explains the essential features of the x-ray-absorption data.},

In those experiments, it is usually assumed that the atomic electrons around the nucleus of the target material immediately follow the motion of the recoil nucleus. In reality, however, it takes some time for the electrons to catch up, which results in ionization and excitation of the atoms. In previous studies, those effects are taken into account by using the so-called Migdal's approach, in which the final state ionization/excitation are treated separately from the nuclear recoil. In this paper, we reformulate the Migdal's approach so that the ``atomic recoil'' cross section is obtained coherently, where we make transparent the energy-momentum conservation and the probability conservation. We show that the final state ionization/excitation can enhance the detectability of rather light dark matter in the GeV mass range via the nuclear scattering. We also discuss the coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, where the same effects are expected.},

  abstract = {Mathematical and computational modeling are key tools in analyzing important biological processes in cells and living organisms. In particular, stochastic models are essential to accurately describe the cellular dynamics, when the assumption of the thermodynamic limit can no longer be applied. However, stochastic models are computationally much more challenging than the traditional deterministic models. Moreover, many biochemical systems arising in applications have multiple time-scales, which lead to mathematical stiffness. In this paper we investigate the numerical solution of a stochastic continuous model of well-stirred biochemical systems, the chemical Langevin equation. The chemical Langevin equation is a stochastic differential equation with multiplicative, non-commutative noise. We propose an adaptive stepsize algorithm for approximating the solution of models of biochemical systems in the Langevin regime, with small noise, based on estimates of the local error. The underlying numerical method is the Milstein scheme. The proposed adaptive method is tested on several examples arising in applications and it is shown to have improved efficiency and accuracy compared to the existing fixed stepsize schemes.},

The adaptive schemes are based on I and PI control, and allow arbitrary values of the stepsize. The explicit Milstein method is applied to approximate the solution of the problem and the adaptive implementations are based on estimates of the local error obtained using Richardson extrapolation. Numerical tests on several models arising in applications show that our adaptive time-stepping schemes perform better than the fixed stepsize alternative and an adaptive Brownian tree time-stepping strategy.},

  abstract = {Metal-insulator transitions are accompanied by huge resistivity changes, even over tens of orders of magnitude, and are widely observed in condensed-matter systems. This article presents the observations and current understanding of the metal-insulator transition with a pedagogical introduction to the subject. Especially important are the transitions driven by correlation effects associated with the electron-electron interaction. The insulating phase caused by the correlation effects is categorized as the Mott Insulator. Near the transition point the metallic state shows fluctuations and orderings in the spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom. The properties of these metals are frequently quite different from those of ordinary metals, as measured by transport, optical, and magnetic probes. The review first describes theoretical approaches to the unusual metallic states and to the metal-insulator transition. The Fermi-liquid theory treats the correlations that can be adiabatically connected with the noninteracting picture. Strong-coupling models that do not require Fermi-liquid behavior have also been developed. Much work has also been done on the scaling theory of the transition. A central issue for this review is the evaluation of these approaches in simple theoretical systems such as the Hubbard model and t-J models. Another key issue is strong competition among various orderings as in the interplay of spin and orbital fluctuations. Experimentally, the unusual properties of the metallic state near the insulating transition have been most extensively studied in d-electron systems. In particular, there is revived interest in transition-metal oxides, motivated by the epoch-making findings of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates and colossal magnetoresistance in manganites. The article reviews the rich phenomena of anomalous metallicity, taking as examples Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Ru compounds. The diverse phenomena include strong spin and orbital fluctuations, mass renormalization effects, incoherence of charge dynamics, and phase transitions under control of key parameters such as band filling, bandwidth, and dimensionality. These parameters are experimentally varied by doping, pressure, chemical composition, and magnetic fields. Much of the observed behavior can be described by the current theory. Open questions and future problems are also extracted from comparison between experimental results and theoretical achievements.},

  abstract = {Recent theoretical studies on the origin of the pseudogap emerging in underdoped cuprate superconductors are overviewed, based on insights obtained by a cluster extension of the dynamical mean field theory (cDMFT) for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Mott insulator. The pseudogap obtained in the cDMFT shows an s-wave-like full-gap structure, distinct from the d-wave superconducting gap. The zero-temperature electronic structure supports that a non-Fermi liquid phase exists and underlies the pseudogap. The non-Fermi liquid phase is separated from the larger-doped Fermi liquid by topological transitions of the Fermi surface and an emergence of zeros of Green's function. A coexisting evolution of the poles (Fermi surface) and zeros of the Green's function is a unique feature of the pseudogap phase. The spectra well reproduce the arc/pocket formation, together with basic experimental properties of the pseudogap phase in the cuprates. Furthermore, a full-gap structure is supported by a comparison with the results of Raman experiments. The overall feature supports the proximity of the Mott insulator and the significance of the quantum criticality of the Mott transition. These numerical results are further favorably interpreted by extending the exciton concept, known in semiconductors, to doped Mott insulators. In this composite fermion (CF) theory, the pseudogap emerges as a gap arising from a hybridization of the quasiparticle (QP) with the CF. The pairing channel opening between a QP and a CF solves the puzzle of the dichotomy between the d-wave superconductivity and the precursory insulating gap in the same antinodal region. A mechanism of superconductivity emerges from this pairing.},

The internal  field  H  n  at the Y site in YTiO 3  is due to the supertransferred  hyperfine interaction, whereas the  H  n  at the La site is canceled  out because of the local symmetry in the antiferromagnetic state of LaTiO 3 .},

  abstract = {We show using bosonization methods that extended Hubbard-Heisenberg models on two types of two leg ladders (without flux and with flux {$\pi$} per plaquette) have commensurate pair-density-wave (PDW) phases. In the case of the conventional (flux-less) ladder, the PDW arises when certain filling fractions for which commensurability conditions are met. For the flux {$\pi$} ladder, the PDW phase is generally present. The PDW phase is characterized by a finite spin gap and a superconducting order parameter with a finite (commensurate in this case) wave vector and power-law superconducting correlations. In this phase, the uniform superconducting order parameter, the 2kF charge-density-wave (CDW) order parameter and the spin-density-wave N\'eel order parameter exhibit short range (exponentially decaying) correlations. We discuss in detail the case in which the bonding band of the ladder is half filled for which the PDW phase appears even at weak coupling. The PDW phase is shown to be dual to a uniform superconducting (SC) phase with quasi-long-range order. By making use of bosonization and the renormalization group, we determine the phase diagram of the spin-gapped regime and study the quantum phase transition. The phase boundary between PDW and the uniform SC ordered phases is found to be in the Ising universality class. We generalize the analysis to the case of other commensurate fillings of the bonding band, where we find higher-order commensurate PDW states for which we determine the form of the effective bosonized field theory and discuss the phase diagram. We compare our results with recent findings in the Kondo-Heisenberg chain. We show that the formation of PDW order in the ladder embodies the notion of intertwined orders.},

Recent advances have identified monolayer WTe2 as a promising material for exploring such interplay in a highly tunable fashion. The ground state of this two-dimensional (2D) crystal can be electrostatically tuned from a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) to a superconductor. However, much remains unknown about the nature of these ground states, including the gap-opening mechanism of the insulating state. Here we report systematic studies of the insulating phase in WTe2 monolayer and uncover evidence supporting that the QSHI is also an excitonic insulator (EI). An EI, arising from the spontaneous formation of electron-hole bound states (excitons), is a largely unexplored quantum phase to date, especially when it is topological. Our experiments on high-quality transport devices reveal the presence of an intrinsic insulating state at the charge neutrality point (CNP) in clean samples. The state exhibits both a strong sensitivity to the electric displacement field and a Hall anomaly that are consistent with the excitonic pairing. We further confirm the correlated nature of this charge-neutral insulator by tunneling spectroscopy. Our results support the existence of an EI phase in the clean limit and rule out alternative scenarios of a band insulator or a localized insulator. These observations lay the foundation for understanding a new class of correlated insulators with nontrivial topology and identify monolayer WTe2 as a promising candidate for exploring quantum phases of ground-state excitons.},

  abstract = {First-principles modeling of systems with localized d states is currently a great challenge in condensed-matter physics. Density-functional theory in the standard local-density approximation (LDA) proves to be problematic. This can be partly overcome by including local Hubbard U corrections (LDA+U) but itinerant states are still treated on the LDA level. Many-body perturbation theory in the GW approach offers both a quasiparticle perspective (appropriate for itinerant states) and an exact treatment of exchange (appropriate for localized states), and is therefore promising for these systems. LDA+U has previously been viewed as an approximate GW scheme. We present here a derivation that is simpler and more general, starting from the static Coulomb-hole and screened exchange approximation to the GW self-energy. Following our previous work for f-electron systems [ H. Jiang, R. I. Gomez-Abal, P. Rinke and M. Scheffler Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 126403 (2009)] we conduct a systematic investigation of the GW method based on LDA+U(GW@LDA+U), as implemented in our recently developed all-electron GW code FHI-gap (Green's function with augmented plane waves) for a series of prototypical d-electron systems: (1) ScN with empty d states, (2) ZnS with semicore d states, and (3) late transition-metal oxides (MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) with partially occupied d states. We show that for ZnS and ScN, the GW band gaps only weakly depend on U but for the other transition-metal oxides the dependence on U is as strong as in LDA+U. These different trends can be understood in terms of changes in the hybridization and screening. Our work demonstrates that GW@LDA+U with ``physical'' values of U provides a balanced and accurate description of both localized and itinerant states.},

  abstract = {Coupled cluster and configuration interaction diagnostics have been examined in order to assess the reliability of single reference quantum methods for a series of 3d transition metal species including hydrides, nitrides, chalcogenides, halides, small clusters, coordination complexes, and metal dimers. Several means of diagnostics have been considered including T1 and D1 diagnostics (the Frobenius norm and matrix 2-norm of coupled cluster amplitudes for single excitations, respectively), C02 (the weight of leading configuration of a complete active space wave function), and \%TAE (percent total atomization energy). T1 and D1 diagnostics are strongly correlated for certain metal?ligand bonding types. The use of T1 and D1 together with \%TAE can provide more reliable assessment of the severity of nondynamical correlation than a single indicator can provide. New criteria, namely T1 {$>$} 0.05, D1 {$>$} 0.15, and |\%TAE| {$>$} 10, are suggested to identify inorganic species with substantial nondynamical correlation. For these systems, energies and spectroscopic properties computed using single reference electronic correlation methods may suffer from large errors and unpredictable behavior. Conversely, a computation where a molecule is below one or more of these thresholds does not always imply domination by a single reference. Some historically pathological molecules such as Mn2 and Cr2 show T1 {$<$} 0.05 and D1 {$<$} 0.15. Current implementations of coupled cluster diagnostics may still be insufficient for categorization of molecules that have pronounced nondynamical correlation. Coupled cluster and configuration interaction diagnostics have been examined in order to assess the reliability of single reference quantum methods for a series of 3d transition metal species including hydrides, nitrides, chalcogenides, halides, small clusters, coordination complexes, and metal dimers. Several means of diagnostics have been considered including T1 and D1 diagnostics (the Frobenius norm and matrix 2-norm of coupled cluster amplitudes for single excitations, respectively), C02 (the weight of leading configuration of a complete active space wave function), and \%TAE (percent total atomization energy). T1 and D1 diagnostics are strongly correlated for certain metal?ligand bonding types. The use of T1 and D1 together with \%TAE can provide more reliable assessment of the severity of nondynamical correlation than a single indicator can provide. New criteria, namely T1 {$>$} 0.05, D1 {$>$} 0.15, and |\%TAE| {$>$} 10, are suggested to identify inorganic species with substantial nondynamical correlation. For these systems, energies and spectroscopic properties computed using single reference electronic correlation methods may suffer from large errors and unpredictable behavior. Conversely, a computation where a molecule is below one or more of these thresholds does not always imply domination by a single reference. Some historically pathological molecules such as Mn2 and Cr2 show T1 {$<$} 0.05 and D1 {$<$} 0.15. Current implementations of coupled cluster diagnostics may still be insufficient for categorization of molecules that have pronounced nondynamical correlation.},

  abstract = {We report the physical properties and electronic structure calculations of a layered chromium oxypnictide, Sr\$\_2\$Cr\$\_3\$As\$\_2\$O\$\_2\$, which crystallizes in a Sr\$\_2\$Mn\$\_3\$As\$\_2\$O\$\_2\$-type structure containing both CrO\$\_2\$ planes and Cr\$\_2\$As\$\_2\$ layers. The newly synthesized material exhibits a metallic conduction with a dominant electron-magnon scattering. Magnetic and specific-heat measurements indicate at least two intrinsic magnetic transitions below room temperature. One is an antiferromagnetic transition at 291 K, probably associated with a spin ordering in the Cr\$\_2\$As\$\_2\$ layers. Another transition is broad, occurring at around 38 K, and possibly due to a short-range spin order in the CrO\$\_2\$ planes. Our first-principles calculations indicate predominant two-dimensional antiferromagnetic exchange couplings, and suggest a KG-type (i.e. K\$\_2\$NiF\$\_4\$ type for CrO\$\_2\$ planes and G type for Cr\$\_2\$As\$\_2\$ layers) magnetic structure, with reduced moments for both Cr sublattices. The corresponding electronic states near the Fermi energy are mostly contributed from Cr-3\$d\$ orbitals which weakly (modestly) hybridize with the O-2\$p\$ (As-4\$p\$) orbitals in the CrO\$\_2\$ (Cr\$\_2\$As\$\_2\$) layers. The bare bandstructure density of states at the Fermi level is only \$\textbackslash sim\$1/4 of the experimental value derived from the low-temperature specific-heat data, consistent with the remarkable electron-magnon coupling. The title compound is argued to be a possible candidate to host superconductivity.},

Student ratings of instruction are not the best gauge of learning. To boost student ratings we have created an evidence of their learning. Ratings of overall teaching effectiveness are moderately correlated with independent measures of student learning and achievement. At one time, it was considered contentious to administer student rating forms. Now such forms have become commonplace because it makes sense to survey students to find out what they think about their experiences in the class over the term. Also new suggestions that reflect on students' learning and creative thinking were proposed here and consequently students rating form has been updated.},

The magnetoresistance is strongly temperature dependent, and exhibits a sharp peak that can be shifted to near room temperature by adjusting processing parameters. Near-room-temperature {$\Delta$}R/R H values of {$\sim$}1300\% at 260 K and {$\sim$}400\% at 280 K have been observed. The presence of grain boundaries appears to be detrimental to achieving very large magnetoresistance in the lanthanum manganite films.

A trace of superconducting phase was found in the nanocrystalline part of the spread, where the film undergoes a metal to insulator transition as a function of composition in a region with the average composition of FeB2. The resistance drop occurs at 4 K, and a diamagnetic signal has also been detected at the same temperature. From the field-dependent resistive transition behavior, we estimate the upper critical field to be approximately 2 T.},

This paper distinguishes between well-structured problems and ill-structured problems. Well-structured problems are constrained problems with convergent solutions that engage the application of a limited number of rules and principles within well-defined parameters. Ill-structured problems possess multiple solutions, solution paths, fewer parameters which are less manipulable, and contain uncertainty about which concepts, rules, and principles are necessary for the solution or how they are organized and which solution is best. For both types of problems, this paper presents models for how learners solve them and models for designing instruction to support problem-solving skill development. The model for solving well-structured problems is based on information processing theories of learning, while the model for solving ill-structured problems relies on an emerging theory of ill-structured problem solving and on constructivist and situated cognition approaches to learning.}

We propose the squared Frobenius norm of the cumulant part of the two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) as a measure of electron correlation that satisfies these criteria. An advantage of this cumulant-based norm is its ability to measure the correlation from spin entanglement, which is not contained in the correlation energy. Alternative measures based on the 2-RDM, such as the von Neumann entropy, do not scale linearly with system size. Properties of the measures are demonstrated with Be, F2, HF, N2, and a hydrogen chain.},

Starting from this full tight-binding model, we derive two effective models that are intended to provide a convenient starting point for theories of {$\pi$}-band electronic properties by achieving accuracy over the full width of the {$\pi$} bands, and especially at the Dirac points, in models with a relatively small number of hopping parameters. The simplified models are then compared with phenomenological Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure\textendash type tight-binding models in an effort to clarify confusion that exists in the literature concerning tight-binding model parameter signs.},

A collinear antiferromagnetic arrangement of the Fe 3 + moments confined to the tetragonal basal plane is found. Bulk magnetic studies on Sr La Fe O 4 show that the properties of this compound are highly anisotropic, and there is evidence for additional magnetic transitions at lower temperatures (30 and 90 K ).

For the exchange correlation (XC) functional we use the nonempirical generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) and meta-GGA. We find that the QMC result also predicts the intra-dimer-row growth of the molecular line over the inter-dimer-row growth, supporting the conclusion based on DFT results. However, the absolute magnitudes of the adsorption/reaction energies and the heights of the energy barriers differ considerably between the QMC and DFT with the GGA/meta-GGA XC functionals.},

It is shown that the sign of the superexchange interaction is closely connected with the cation orbital state, when the cation is subject to the crystalline field arising from octahedrally or tetrahedrally surrounding anions. In some cases, the sign of the superexchange interaction is definitely determined from the symmetry relations. The cases in which each cation is subject to an octahedral cubic field and the lines connecting the interacting cations to the intervening anion make an angle of either 180\textdegree{} or 90\textdegree{} are discussed in particular. Our discussion of the 180\textdegree{} case is applicable to crystals of the perovskite type and NaCl type and that of the 90\textdegree{} case to anhydrous chlorides. In the case where each cation is subject to a tetrahedral cubic field, there is a definite relation between the symmetry of the cation electron orbitals and superexchange interaction, if only the s-orbital of anion participates in the superexchange interaction. TiH2 is an example of this case. The interaction between nearest-neighbor cations in the crystal of the NaCl type is also discussed.},

First, we estimate the tight-binding bands of Ti 3d and Se 4p orbitals in the monolayer TiSe2 on the basis of the first-principles band-structure calculations. We thereby show orbital textures of the undistorted band structure near the Fermi level. Next, we derive the electron-phonon coupling using the tight-binding approximation and show that the softening occurs in the transverse phonon mode at the M point of the Brillouin zone. The stability of the triple-q CDW state is thus examined to show that the transverse phonon modes at the M1, M2, and M3 points are frozen simultaneously. Then, we introduce the intersite Coulomb interactions between the nearest-neighbor Ti and Se atoms that lead to the excitonic instability between the valence Se 4p and conduction Ti 3d bands. Treating the intersite Coulomb interactions in the mean-field approximation, we show that the electron-phonon and excitonic interactions cooperatively stabilize the triple-q CDW state in TiSe2. We also calculate a single-particle spectrum in the CDW state and reproduce the band folding spectra observed in photoemission spectroscopies. Finally, to clarify the nature of the CDW state, we examine the electronic charge density distribution and show that the CDW state in TiSe2 is of a bond type and induces a vortexlike antiferroelectric polarization in the kagome network of Ti atoms.},

  abstract = {The recently discovered high-Tc superconductor Ca1-xLaxFeAs2 is a unique compound not only because of its low-symmetry crystal structure but also because of its electronic structure, which hosts Dirac-like metallic bands resulting from (spacer) zigzag As chains. We present a comprehensive first-principles theoretical study of the electronic and crystal structures of Ca1-xLaxFeAs2. After discussing the connection between the crystal structure of the 112 family, which Ca1-xLaxFeAs2 is a member of, with the other known structures of Fe pnictide superconductors, we check the thermodynamic phase stability of CaFeAs2, and similar hyphothetical compounds SrFeAs2 and BaFeAs2 which, we find, are slightly higher in energy. We calculate the optical conductivity of Ca1-xLaxFeAs2 using the DFT+DMFT method and predict a large in-plane resistivity anisotropy in the normal phase, which does not originate from electronic nematicity, but is enhanced by the electronic correlations. In particular, we predict a 0.34 eV peak in the yy component of the optical conductivity of the 30\% La-doped compound, which corresponds to coherent interband transitions within a fast-dispersing band arising from the zigzag As chains, which are unique to this compound. We also study the Landau free energy for Ca1-xLaxFeAs2 including the order parameter relevant for the nematic transition and find that the free energy does not have any extra terms that could induce ferro-orbital order. This explains why the presence of As chains does not broaden the nematic transition in Ca1-xLaxFeAs2.},

The analysis derived from the X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy patterns indicates that Mn atoms should react with Si atoms and then form Mn4Si7 compounds.

We find that, in marked contrast to Weyl semimetals, the gapless surface states of DSMs are not topologically protected in general, except on time-reversal-invariant planes of surface Brillouin zone.

Generically, the arcs deform into a Fermi pocket, similar to the surface states of a topological insulator, and this pocket can merge into the projection of bulk Dirac Fermi surfaces as the chemical potential is varied. We make sharp predictions for the doping dependence of the surface states of a DSM that can be tested by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillation experiments.},

The predictor reveals trends in magnetic interactions that are often not apparent from the space group of the compounds, such as triclinic or monoclinic compounds that are strongly 2D. We present specific cases where the predictor identifies compounds that should exhibit competition between 1D and 2D interactions, and how the predictor can be used to identify sparsely populated regions of chemical space with as-yet-unexplored topologies of specific 3d magnetic cations. The predictor can be accessed for the full list of compounds using a searchable front end and further information on the connectivity, symmetry, valence, and cation-anion and cation-cation coordination can be freely exported.},

However, using the density functional theory, we have identified two more stable structures for the AlH3 with the cubic and orthorhombic symmetries. Based on the quasiharmonic approximation, the cubic and orthorhombic AlH3 are almost degenerate when the zero-point energies are included. The geometric and electronic structures, the phonon, and the thermodynamic properties for the hexagonal, cubic, and orthorhombic AlH3 have been studied by means of density functional theory and direct ab initio force constant approach. The calculated electronic structures, phonon density of states, and thermodynamic functions [including S(T) and H(T)-H(0)] for the three hydrides are similar. The results show that these three hydrides have negative enthalpies of formation, but positive free energies of formation. This conclusion is the same as that made by Wolverton et al. for the hexagonal AlH3 [Phys. Rev. B 69, 144109 (2004)]. The thermodynamic properties indicate that the orthorhombic and cubic AlH3 should be more difficult to dissociate than the hexagonal AlH3.},

The one-body density matrix and energies are obtained from a Slater-Jastrow wave function with a determinant of local-density approximation (LDA) orbitals. The QMC density matrix evaluated in a basis of LDA orbitals is strongly diagonally dominant. The natural orbitals obtained by diagonalizing the QMC density matrix resemble the LDA orbitals very closely. Replacing the determinant of LDA orbitals in the wave function by a determinant of natural orbitals makes no significant difference to the quality of the wave function's nodal surface, leaving the diffusion Monte Carlo energy unchanged. The extended Koopmans's theorem for correlated wave functions is used to calculate excitation energies for silicon, which are in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data. A diagonal approximation to the theorem, evaluated in the basis of LDA orbitals, works quite well for both the quasihole and quasielectron states. We have found that this approximation has an advantageous scaling with system size, allowing more efficient studies of larger systems.},

  abstract = {Iron complexes are important spin crossover (SCO) systems with vital roles in oxidative metabolism and promising technological potential. The SCO tendency depends on the free energy balance of high- and low-spin states, which again depends on physical effects such as dispersion, relativistic effects, and vibrational entropy. This work studied 30 different iron SCO systems with experimentally known thermochemical data, using 12 different density functionals. Remarkably general entropy?enthalpy compensation across SCO systems was identified (R = 0.82, p = 0.002) that should be considered in rational SCO design. Iron(II) complexes displayed higher ?H and ?S values than iron(III) complexes and also less steep compensation effects. First-coordination sphere ?S values computed from numerical frequencies reproduce most of the experimental entropy and should thus be included when modeling spin-state changes in inorganic chemistry (R = 0.52, p = 3.4 ? 10?3; standard error in T?S {$\approx$} 4.4 kJ/mol at 298 K vs 16 kJ/mol of total T?S on average). Zero-point energies favored high-spin states by 9 kJ/mol on average. Interestingly, dispersion effects are surprisingly large for the SCO process (average: 9 kJ/mol, but up to 33 kJ/mol) and favor the more compact low-spin state. Relativistic effects favor low-spin by ?9 kJ/mol on average, but up to 24 kJ/mol. B3LYP*, TPSSh, B2PLYP, and PW6B95 performed best for the typical calculation scheme that includes ZPE. However, if relativistic and dispersion effects are included, only B3LYP* remained accurate. On average, high-spin was favored by LYP by 11?15 kJ/mol relative to other correlation functionals, and by 4.2 kJ/mol per 1\% HF exchange in hybrids. 13\% HF exchange was optimal without dispersion, and 15\% was optimal with all effects included for these systems.},

In this work we demonstrate the formation of emergent correlated phases in multilayer rhombohedral graphene - a simple material that also exhibits a flat electronic band but without the need of having a moir\textbackslash 'e superlattice induced by twisted van der Waals layers. We show that two layers of bilayer graphene that are twisted by an arbitrary tiny angle host large (micron-scale) regions of uniform rhombohedral four-layer (ABCA) graphene that can be independently studied. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals that ABCA graphene hosts an unprecedentedly sharp flat band of 3-5 meV half-width. We demonstrate that when this flat band straddles the Fermi level, a correlated many-body gap emerges with peak-to-peak value of 9.5 meV at charge neutrality. Mean field theoretical calculations indicate that the two primary candidates for the appearance of this broken symmetry state are a charge transfer excitonic insulator and a ferrimagnet. Finally, we show that ABCA graphene hosts surface topological helical edge states at natural interfaces with ABAB graphene which can be turned on and off with gate voltage, implying that small angle twisted double bilayer graphene is an ideal programmable topological quantum material.},

We report the observation of a related electronic state in a noncuprate material, strontium iridate (Sr2IrO4), in which the distinct cuprate fermiology is largely reproduced. Upon surface electron doping through in situ deposition of alkali-metal atoms, angle-resolved photoemission spectra of Sr2IrO4 display disconnected segments of zero-energy states, known as Fermi arcs, and a gap as large as 80 millielectron volts. Its evolution toward a normal metal phase with a closed Fermi surface as a function of doping and temperature parallels that in the cuprates. Our result suggests that Sr2IrO4 is a useful model system for comparison to the cuprates. Identifying a cuprate look-alike Superconductivity in cuprate compounds remains poorly understood. Recreating its features in an unrelated material may provide insight. Kim et al. used a spectroscopic technique to study the electronic states of the material Sr2IrO4 at relatively high temperatures. They observed phenomenology similar to that of cuprates as they varied the surface carrier concentration. The study highlights the essential properties a material needs in order to exhibit cuprate-like features in the normal (nonsuperconducting) state. Science, this issue p. 187},

The performance gain on recent HPC systems is largely driven by increasing parallelism: the number of compute cores of a SMP and the number of SMPs have been going up, as the Top500 list attests. However, the available memory as well as the communication and memory bandwidth per element has not kept pace with the increasing parallelism. This severely limits the applicability of QMC and the problem size it can handle. OpenMP/MPI hybrid programming provides applications with simple but effective solutions to overcome efficiency and scalability bottlenecks on large-scale clusters based on multi/many-core SMPs. We discuss the design and implementation of hybrid methods in QMCPACK and analyze its performance on current HPC platforms characterized by various memory and communication hierarchies.},

  abstract = {A lithium salt of anionic scandium tetraborohydride complex, LiSc(BH4)4, was studied both experimentally and theoretically as a potential hydrogen storage medium. Ball milling mixtures of LiBH4 and ScCl3 produced LiCl and a unique crystalline hydride, which has been unequivocally identified via multinuclear solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to be LiSc(BH4)4. Under the present reaction conditions, there was no evidence for the formation of binary Sc(BH4)3. These observations are in agreement with our first-principles calculations of the relative stabilities of these phases. A tetragonal structure in space group I{$\overline 4$} (\#82) is predicted to be the lowest energy state for LiSc(BH4)4, which does not correspond to structures obtained to date on the crystalline ternary borohydride phases made by ball milling. Perhaps reaction conditions are resulting in formation of other polymorphs, which should be investigated in future studies via neutron scattering on deuterides. Hydrogen desorption while heating these Li-Sc-B-H materials up to 400 \textdegree C yielded only amorphous phases (besides the virtually unchanged LiCl) that were determined by NMR to be primarily ScB2 and [B12H12]-2 anion containing (e.g., Li2B12H12) along with residual LiBH4. Reaction of a desorbed LiSc(BH4)4 + 4LiCl mixture (from 4LiBH4/ScCl3 sample) with hydrogen gas at {$\sim$}70 bar resulted only in an increase in the contents of Li2B12H12 and LiBH4. Full reversibility to reform the LiSc(BH4)4 was not found. Overall, the Li-Sc-B-H system is not a favorable candidate for hydrogen storage applications.},

The structure of VO 2 is investigated by micro-Raman scattering experiments. An analysis of the Raman-active A g modes at 195 and 222 cm - 1 , explained by pairing and tilting of V cations, and 622 cm - 1 , shows that the modes below a low compliance (restricted) current do not change when the MIT occurs, whereas a structural phase transition above the low compliance current is found to occur secondarily, due to heating effects in the device induced by the MIT.

  abstract = {As the end draws near for Moore's law, the search for low-power alternatives to complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology is intensifying. Among the various post-CMOS candidates, spintronic devices have gained special attention for their potential to overcome the power and performance limitations of CMOS. In particular, all spin logic (ASL) technology, which performs Boolean operations and transfers the output in the spin domain, has been proposed for enabling new capabilities-such as high density, low device count, and nonvolatility-that were previously impossible with CMOS technology. In this paper, first we provide an overview of the history and the current status of the various spintronic devices being pursued by the research community. Then, we describe how spin-based components are integrated into a computing system and the advantages that result. We use a hypothetical spintronic-based Intel Core i7 as a test vehicle to compare the system-level power requirements of ASL- and CMOS-based systems, taking into consideration the unique demands of spin-based interconnects. We conclude with a brief analysis of current limitations and future directions of spintronic research.},

Underdoped cuprates possess certain antiferromagnetic correlations, as evidenced, for example, by different temperature dependence of the Cu and O site NMR relaxation rates, that are not captured well by slave boson mean field theories of thet-Jmodel. We show that the inclusion of gauge fluctuations will remedy the deficiencies of the mean field theories. As a concrete illustration of the gauge-fluctuation restoration of the antiferromangetic correlation and the feasibility of the 1/Nperturbation theory, the Heisenberg spin chain is analyzed in terms of a 1+1D U(1) gauge theory with massless Dirac fermions. The 1/N-perturbative treatment of the same gauge theory in 2+1D (which can be motivated from the mean field{$\pi$}-flux phase of the Heisenberg model) leads to a dynamical mass generation corresponding to an antiferromagnetic ordering. On the other hand, it is argued that in a similar gauge theory with an additional coupling to a Bose (holon) field, symmetry breaking does not occur, but antiferromagnetic correlations are enhanced, which is the situation in the underdoped cuprates.},

Strong coupling or competition between various orders in these systems presents the key to manipulate their functional properties by means of external perturbations such as electric and magnetic fields or pressure. Ultrashort and intense optical pulses have emerged as an interesting tool to investigate elementary dynamics and control material properties by melting an existing order. Here, we employ few-cycle multi-terahertz pulses to resonantly probe the evolution of the spin-density-wave (SDW) gap of the pnictide compound BaFe2As2 following excitation with a femtosecond optical pulse. When starting in the low-temperature ground state, optical excitation results in a melting of the SDW order, followed by ultrafast recovery. In contrast, the SDW gap is induced when we excite the normal state above the transition temperature. Very surprisingly, the transient ordering quasi-adiabatically follows a coherent lattice oscillation at a frequency as high as 5.5 THz. Our results attest to a pronounced spin\textendash phonon coupling in pnictides that supports rapid development of a macroscopic order on small vibrational displacement even without breaking the symmetry of the crystal.},

  abstract = {The character of the ground state of an antiferromagnetic insulator is fundamentally altered following addition of even a small amount of charge. The added charge is concentrated into domain walls across which a phase shift in the spin correlations of the host material is induced. In two dimensions, these domain walls are 'stripes' which can be insulating, or conducting \textemdash{} that is, metallic 'rivers' with their own low-energy degrees of freedom. However, in arrays of one-dimensional metals, which occur in materials such as organic conductors, interactions between stripes typically drive a transition to an insulating ordered charge-density-wave (CDW) state at low temperatures. Here it is shown that such a transition is eliminated if the zero-point energy of transverse stripe fluctuations is sufficiently large compared tothe CDW coupling between stripes. As a consequence, there should exist electronic quantum liquid-crystal phases, which constitute new states of matter, and which can be either high-temperature superconductors or two-dimensional anisotropic 'metallic' non-Fermi liquids. Neutron scattering and other experiments in the copper oxide superconductor La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4 already provide evidence for the existence of these phases in at least one class of materials.},

At 0 K and ambient pressures MgAlH5 and BaAlH5 crystallize in monoclinic (CaFeF5 type, P21/c) and orthorhombic (prototype, Pna21) structures, respectively. In addition to the ground-state MgAlH5 phase (here designated {$\alpha$}-MgAlH5), it is also predicted a metastable modification (termed {$\beta$}-MgAlH5, CaCrF5 type, Cc). The structures comprise isolated, highly distorted AlH6 octahedra, which form one-dimensional chains along the [001] direction. In {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-MgAlH5 these chains are fairly linear, while BaAlH5 exhibits distinct zigzag chains. {$\alpha$}-MgAlH5 and BaAlH5 are nonmetallic phases with estimated band gaps of 2.48 and 2.73 eV, respectively.

However, ways how to improve its accuracy are being sought and here we explore the relevance of singles contributions for prototypical solid state systems. We set out with a derivation of the random phase approximation using the adiabatic connection and fluctuation dissipation theorem, but contrary to the most commonly used derivation, the density is allowed to vary along the coupling constant integral. This yields results closely paralleling standard perturbation theory. We re-derive the standard singles of G\"orling-Levy perturbation theory [A. G\"orling and M. Levy, Phys. Rev. A 50, 196 (1994)], highlight the analogy of our expression to the renormalized singles introduced by Ren and coworkers [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 153003 (2011)], and introduce a new approximation for the singles using the density matrix in the random phase approximation. We discuss the physical relevance and importance of singles alongside illustrative examples of simple weakly bonded systems, including rare gas solids (Ne, Ar, Xe), ice, adsorption of water on NaCl, and solid benzene. The effect of singles on covalently and metallically bonded systems is also discussed.},

Like dynamical mean-field theory, DMET maps the bulk interacting system to a simpler impurity model and is exact in the noninteracting and atomic limits. Unlike dynamical mean-field theory, DMET is formulated in terms of the frequency-independent local density matrix, rather than the local Green's function. In addition, it features a finite, algebraically constructible bath of only one bath site per impurity site, with no bath discretization error. Frequency independence and the minimal bath make DMET a computationally simple and efficient method. We test the theory in the one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models at and away from half filling, and we find that compared to benchmark data, total energies, correlation functions, and metal-insulator transitions are well reproduced, at a tiny computational cost.},

  abstract = {Modern quantum chemistry can make quantitative predictions on an immense array of chemical systems. However, the interpretation of those predictions is often complicated by the complex wave function expansions used. Here we show that an exceptionally simple algebraic construction allows for defining atomic core and valence orbitals, polarized by the molecular environment, which can exactly represent self-consistent field wave functions. This construction provides an unbiased and direct connection between quantum chemistry and empirical chemical concepts, and can be used, for example, to calculate the nature of bonding in molecules, in chemical terms, from first principles. In particular, we find consistency with electronegativities (?), C 1s core-level shifts, resonance substituent parameters ({$\sigma$}R), Lewis structures, and oxidation states of transition-metal complexes.},

Excitonic condensation has been studied in systems such as quantum Hall bilayers where physical separation between electrons and holes enables a longer lifetime for their bound states. Kogar et al. observed excitons condensing in the three-dimensional semimetal 1T-TiSe2. In such systems, distinguishing exciton condensation from other types of order is tricky. To do so, the authors used momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy, a technique developed to probe electronic collective excitations. The energy needed to excite an electronic mode became negligible at a finite momentum, signifying the formation of a condensate. Science, this issue p. 1314 Bose condensation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, atomic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an insulating electronic crystal. Using the recently developed technique of momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied electronic collective modes in the transition metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1T-TiSe2. Near the phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the electronic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence electrons into an exciton condensate. Our study provides compelling evidence for exciton condensation in a three-dimensional solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile technique sensitive to valence band excitations in quantum materials. The softening of an electronic mode of 1T-TiSe2 is seen with momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy.

In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials. (The exchange portion of our effective potential differs from that due to Slater by a factor of 23.) Electronic systems at finite temperatures and in magnetic fields are also treated by similar methods.

We introduce atomic-resolution tunneling-asymmetry imaging, finding virtually identical phenomena in two lightly hole-doped cuprates: Ca1.88Na0.12CuO2Cl2 and Bi2Sr2Dy0.2Ca0.8Cu2O8+{$\delta$}. Intense spatial variations in tunneling asymmetry occur primarily at the planar oxygen sites; their spatial arrangement forms a Cu-O-Cu bond-centered electronic pattern without long-range order but with 4a0-wide unidirectional electronic domains dispersed throughout (a0: the Cu-O-Cu distance). The emerging picture is then of a partial hole localization within an intrinsic electronic glass evolving, at higher hole densities, into complete delocalization and highest-temperature superconductivity.},

The accuracy of these values is further supported by calculations on the S22 benchmark set of noncovalently bound systems, for which we obtain a small mean absolute deviation of 0.68 kcal/mol. Our results support previous claims that the stacking energies are of comparable magnitude to the interactions of the commonly discussed hydrogen-bonded motif. Furthermore, we show that QMC can serve as an advantageous alternative to conventional wave function methods for large noncovalently bound systems.

  abstract = {The intramolecular magnetic coupling constants (J) of 9 diradicals (i?ix) coupled with an aromatic ring were investigated by means of unrestricted density functional theory (DFT) calculations [UB3LYP/6-311++G(d,p)]. For these diradicals, a remarkable linear relationship between the calculated and experimental J values was found. In this study, we suggest that the slope (0.380) of the linear relationship can be utilized as a scaling factor for estimating J values. By applying this scaling factor and calculating J values, we could predict the reliable J values of four dithiadiazolyl (DTDA) diradicals coupled with an aromatic ring. It was also found that this scaling scheme shows a dependence on the length of a coupler. Nevertheless, this scaling approach could be used to estimate J values for diverse diradical systems coupled with a particular coupler by DFT calculations.},

Starting from the screening of long-range interactions in these systems, the existence of an emerging Dirac liquid of Lorentz invariant quasiparticles in the weak-coupling regime is discussed, as well as the formation of strongly correlated electronic states in the strong-coupling regime. The analogy and connections between the many-body problem and the Coulomb impurity problem are also analyzed. The problem of the magnetic instability and Kondo effect of impurities and/or adatoms in graphene is also discussed in analogy with classical models of many-body effects in ordinary metals. Lorentz invariance is shown to play a fundamental role and leads to effects that span the whole spectrum, from the ultraviolet to the infrared. The effect of an emerging Lorentz invariance is also discussed in the context of finite size and edge effects as well as mesoscopic physics. The effects of strong magnetic fields in single layers and some of the main aspects of the many-body problem in graphene bilayers are briefly reviewed. In addition to reviewing the fully understood aspects of the many-body problem in graphene, a plethora of interesting issues are shown to remain open, both theoretically and experimentally, and the field of graphene research is still exciting and vibrant.},

In particular, we construct MLWFs for the Mn eg bands in LaMnO3, and we monitor changes in the MLWF matrix elements induced by different magnetic configurations and structural distortions. By comparing our results with commonly used model Hamiltonians for manganites, where electrons can hop between two ``eg-like'' orbitals located on each Mn site, we obtain values for the local Jahn-Teller and Hund's rule coupling strength, the hopping amplitudes between all nearest and further neighbors, and the corresponding reduction due to the GdFeO3-type distortion. In addition, our analysis allows us to systematically assess and quantify the limitations of such an effective eg-band description. We find that the most crucial limitation of such models stems from neglecting changes in the underlying Mn(d)-O(p) hybridization, which not only lead to a significant difference in hopping for (local) spin majority/minority electrons but also to a nonlocal effect of the Jahn-Teller distortion and a significant reduction in the local Jahn-Teller coupling strength due to the GdFeO3-type distortion.},

We first establish the effect of the Jahn-Teller distortion within the d-p model, and then compare the TB representations for both models obtained from GGA+U calculations with different values of the Hubbard parameter U. We find that in the case of the d-p model the TB parameters are rather independent of the specific value of U, if compared with the mean-field approximation of an appropriate multiband Hubbard Hamiltonian. In contrast, the U dependence of the TB parameters for the effective eg model cannot easily be related to a corresponding mean-field Hubbard model, and therefore these parameters depend critically on the specific value of U, and more generally on the specific exchange-correlation functional, used in the electronic structure calculation.},

The polaronic nature of the carriers is also a manifestation of strong electron-lattice interaction. One can propose an experiment that allows an unambiguous determination of the intermediate boson (phonon, magnon, exciton, etc.) which provides the pairing. The electron-lattice interaction increases for nanosystems, and this is due to an effective increase in the density of states.},

Using these single determinant nodal surfaces, DMC results in errors of 1.5(1) kcal/mol on barrier heights. Using the large data set of DMC energies, we attempted to find good descriptors of the fixed node error. It does not correlate with a number of descriptors including change in density but does show some correlation with the gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbital energies in the mean-field calculation.},

The high-energy resolution allows for a detailed observation of spectral properties. A sharpening of the optical phonon modes and shift of all spectral features toward higher energies by {$\sim$}4\% with decreasing temperature from 296 to 10 K was found. However, no detectable change at the tetragonal\textendash orthorhombic phase transition around 100 K was observed. Application of a pressure of 6.7 GPa, connected with an increase in the superconducting temperature from 8 to 34 K, results in an increase in the optical phonon mode energies at 296 K by {$\sim$}12\%, and an even more pronounced increase for the lowest-lying transversal acoustic mode. Despite these strong pressure-induced modifications of the phonon-DOS we conclude that the pronounced increase in Tc in Fe1.01Se with pressure cannot be described in the framework of classical electron-phonon coupling. This result suggests the importance of spin fluctuations to the observed superconductivity.},

It was observed that {$\alpha-$}RuCl3 undergoes a structural phase transition at Tt{$\simeq$}150 K accompanied by fairly large hysteresis. This structural phase transition is expected to be similar to that observed in closely related CrCl3. The magnetizations and magnetic susceptibilities are strongly anisotropic, which mainly arise from the anisotropic g factors, i.e., gab{$\simeq$}2.5 and gc{$\simeq$}0.4 for magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the ab plane, respectively. These g factors and the obtained entropy indicate that the effective spin of Ru3+ is one-half, which results from the low-spin state. Specific heat data show that magnetic ordering occurs in four steps at zero magnetic field. The successive magnetic phase transitions should be ascribed to the competition among exchange interactions. The magnetic phase diagram for H{$\parallel$}ab is obtained. We discuss the strongly anisotropic g factors in {$\alpha-$}RuCl3 and deduce that the exchange interaction is strongly XY-like. {$\alpha-$}RuCl3 is magnetically described as a three-dimensionally coupled XY-like frustrated magnet on a honeycomb lattice.},

  abstract = {The extensive experimental and computational search for multifunctional materials has resulted in the development of semiconductor and oxide systems, such as (Ga,Mn)N, (Zn,Cr)Te and HfO2, which exhibit surprisingly stable ferromagnetic signatures despite having a small or nominally zero concentration of magnetic elements. Here, we show that the ferromagnetism of (Zn,Cr)Te, and the associated magnetooptical and magnetotransport functionalities, are dominated by the formation of Cr-rich (Zn,Cr)Te metallic nanocrystals embedded in the Cr-poor (Zn,Cr)Te matrix. Importantly, the formation of these nanocrystals can be controlled by manipulating the charge state of the Cr ions during the epitaxy. The findings provide insight into the origin of ferromagnetism in a broad range of semiconductors and oxides, and indicate possible functionalities of these composite systems. Furthermore, they demonstrate a bottom-up method for self-organized nanostructure fabrication that is applicable to any system in which the charge state of a constituent depends on the Fermi-level position in the host semiconductor.},

The energy increments E l (2) corresponding to the partial wave expansion of {$\chi$} go asymptotically as l-8, while conventional partial wave increments go as l-4. {$\chi$} is coupled to {$\Phi$} by a ``residual'' interaction U12 that has no singularity for r12=0. With the present ansatz it is sufficient to include l-values up to 5 in order to get the second-order energy accurate to one microhartree. For the same accuracy l{$\leq$}4 is sufficient in a ``CI with correlated reference function'' while in conventional CI one must go to l{$\sim$}50. The surprisingly faster convergence of the variational approach as compared to second-order perturbation theory is explained. The slow convergence of the traditional partial wave expansion is entirely due to the attempt to represent the quantity 1={$\langle\Phi$}\textbrokenbar r12r12 -1\textbrokenbar{$\Phi\rangle$} by its partial wave expansion. The best reference function {$\Phi$} shows very little shielding and resembles closely the eigenstate of the bare nuclear Hamiltonian.

  abstract = {The Hamiltonian H for an n-electron system in a finite one-electron basis of dimension m is characterized by d=O(m4) matrix elements. The eigenstates of this Hamiltonian\textemdash i.e., the full-CI states {$\Psi$}\textemdash depend, however, on the usually much larger set of N=O(mn) parameters. One can, nevertheless, write a full-CI state as {$\Psi$}=eS{$\Phi$} with {$\Phi$} a reference function and S an operator familiar from traditional coupled cluster (TCC) theory. The ``exact'' operator S can be expressed (though in an implicit and rather complicated way) in terms of d parameters. An alternative ansatz {$\Psi$}=eT{$\Phi$} with T depending in a very simple way on d parameters only (namely, with T having the same structure in Fock space as H) has been studied by Nooijen and by Nakatsuji and been called coupled-cluster with generalized single and double excitations (CCGSD). Nooijen has conjectured that the full-CI equations can be fulfilled with this ansatz. This paper is devoted to a comprehensive analysis of the Nooijen conjecture (NC). Several features make this analysis difficult and even intriguing. (a) One deals with coupled nonlinear systems of equations, for which theorems concerning the existence of their solution are hardly available. (b) There are different possible interpretations of the NC, especially as far as the choice of the reference function {$\Phi$} is concerned. (c) There are solutions of the CCGSD equations, for which some elements of T becomes negative infinite, and eT becomes a projection operator. Such solutions are undesired but difficult to eliminate. We show by direct comparison of the exact wave operator with that of CCGSD theory, for a closed-shell state with {$\Phi$} a single Slater determinant, using a perturbation expansion, that CCGSD cannot be exact. This required a reformulation of the CCGSD operator eT to an equivalent exponential form eR, with R similar to the S of TCC theory, but with constraints on the cluster amplitudes, such that these depend on d parameters only. The CCGSD ansatz simulates three-particle and higher excitations, in a perturbation expansion even with diagrams of the correct topology, but with incorrect energy denominators. Differences to the exact formulation arise to second order in perturbation theory for the wave function and to fourth order in the energy, but even the contributions which are not exact, are often acceptable approximations. Essential for the proof that the CCGSD ansatz is not potentially exact is that the set of one- and two-particle basis operators, into which H can be expanded, does not span a Lie algebra. What matters is actually that the variations of the wave function describable within a CCGSD ansatz are different from those required to satisfy the two-particle contracted Schr\"odinger equations. The first attempt, due to Nakatsuji, to prove in this philosophy that the CCGSD ansatz is not potentially exact, was essentially correct, but some subtle yet important aspects were not sufficiently stressed. A refinement was given by Mazziotti. Papers by Ronen and Davidson addressed a somewhat academic problem\textemdash namely, the possible validity of the CCGSD ansatz for a completely arbitrary reference function\textemdash using mainly dimensionality arguments.},

  abstract = {The approach to the theory of many-particle interacting systems from a unified standpoint, based on the variational principle for free energy is reviewed. A systematic discussion is given of the approximate free energies of complex statistical systems. The analysis is centered around the variational principle of N. N. Bogoliubov for free energy in the context of its applications to various problems of statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics. The review presents a terse discussion of selected works carried out over the past few decades on the theory of many-particle interacting systems in terms of the variational inequalities. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss some of the general principles which form the mathematical background to this approach, and to establish a connection of the variational technique with other methods, such as the method of the mean (or self-consistent) field in the many-body problem, in which the effect of all the other particles on any given particle is approximated by a single averaged effect, thus reducing a many-body problem to a single-body problem. The method is illustrated by applying it to various systems of many-particle interacting systems, such as Ising and Heisenberg models, superconducting and superfluid systems, strongly correlated systems, etc. It seems likely that these technical advances in the many-body problem will be useful in suggesting new methods for treating and understanding many-particle interacting systems. This work proposes a new, general and pedagogical presentation, intended both for those who are interested in basic aspects, and for those who are interested in concrete applications.},

A marked orbital dependence of the Z's emerges even if in general the orbital-selective Mott transition only occurs for relatively large values of U.

  abstract = {The local-density and generalized gradient approximations (LDA and GGA) to density functional theory (DFT) exhibit incomplete error cancellation when energy differences are taken between chemically dissimilar systems. This energy inconsistency is manifested, e.g., in the tendency to underestimate the heat (enthalpy) of formation of semiconducting and insulating compounds in LDA and, even more so, in GGA. Considering a set of 61 compounds that can be formed from 14 elements (cations: Cu, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Al, Ga, and In; anions: N, P, As, O, S, and Se), optimized elemental reference energies are determined by least-squares error minimization of an overdetermined set of linear equations. These elemental energies are ``optimally consistent'' with the DFT energies of the semiconductor compounds and imply corrections of up to 1 eV compared to the respective LDA or GGA energies. While these ``corrections'' are not to be understood to yield the correct absolute total energies of the elements, they are proposed to give appropriate bounds for the chemical potentials for thermodynamic processes in semiconductors and insulators, such as, e.g., defect formation, surface reconstruction, or catalytic processes. The present model allows to evaluate thermodynamic processes using DFT energy differences taken only between systems that are expected to show good error cancellation.},

Interaction energies, calculated from Density Functional Theory (DFT), for the adsorption of the ethanol on Au(1 1 1) surfaces are used to train Ensembles of Feed-Forward Neural Networks (EnsFFNNs). The distance of the ethanol molecule to the surface, two angles describing the molecular orientation relatively to the surface, and three binary descriptors encoding the gold adsorption sites, are the input to the NNs. The training sets contain energy values at different distances, for seven molecular orientations and three adsorption sites. The models are assessed by: (a) internal cross validation; (b) Leave-One-Out procedure (LOO); and (c) external test sets corresponding to orientations not used in the training procedure. The results are compared with the ones obtained from an analytical force field recently proposed by some of us to match the DFT data. It is shown that NNs can be trained to map PES with a similar or better accuracy than analytical representations. This is a relevant point, particularly in simulations by Monte Carlo (MC) or Molecular Dynamics (MD), which require an extensive screening of the interaction sites at the interface, turning the development of analytical functions a non-trivial task as the complexity of the systems increases.},

Within this phase it has been unclear which electronic symmetries (if any) are broken, what the identity of any associated order parameter might be, and which microscopic electronic degrees of freedom are active. Here we report the determination of a quantitative order parameter representing intra-unit-cell nematicity: the breaking of rotational symmetry by the electronic structure within each CuO2 unit cell. We analyse spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunnelling microscope images of the intra-unit-cell states in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 + {$\delta$} and, using two independent evaluation techniques, find evidence for electronic nematicity of the states close to the pseudogap energy. Moreover, we demonstrate directly that these phenomena arise from electronic differences at the two oxygen sites within each unit cell. If the characteristics of the pseudogap seen here and by other techniques all have the same microscopic origin, this phase involves weak magnetic states at the O sites that break 90\textdegree -rotational symmetry within every CuO2 unit cell.},

Theoretically, several possibilities for the insulating ground states have been predicted for weak interaction strength. However, a recent renormalization-group calculation on a Hubbard model for charge-neutral bilayer graphene with short-range interactions suggests the emergence of low-energy Dirac fermions that would stabilize the metallic phase for weak interactions. Using a nonperturbative projective quantum Monte Carlo, we calculate the ground state for bilayer graphene using a realistic model for the Coulomb interaction that includes both short-range and long-range contributions. We find that a finite critical on-site interaction is needed to gap bilayer graphene and the transition belongs to the Gross-Neveu universality class, thereby confirming the Hubbard model expectations even in the presence of a long-range Coulomb potential, in agreement with our theoretical analysis. In addition, we also find that the critical on-site interactions necessary to destabilize the metallic ground state decrease with increasing interlayer coupling.},

As a consequence, electrical conductivity and the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity are typically proportional to each other. Lee et al. found a large violation of this so-called Wiedemann-Franz law near the insulator-metal transition in VO2 nanobeams. In the metallic phase, the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity was much smaller than what would be expected from the Wiedemann-Franz law. The results can be explained in terms of independent propagation of charge and heat in a strongly correlated system. Science, this issue p. 371 In electrically conductive solids, the Wiedemann-Franz law requires the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity to be proportional to electrical conductivity. Violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law are typically an indication of unconventional quasiparticle dynamics, such as inelastic scattering, or hydrodynamic collective motion of charge carriers, typically pronounced only at cryogenic temperatures. We report an order-of-magnitude breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law at high temperatures ranging from 240 to 340 kelvin in metallic vanadium dioxide in the vicinity of its metal-insulator transition. Different from previously established mechanisms, the unusually low electronic thermal conductivity is a signature of the absence of quasiparticles in a strongly correlated electron fluid where heat and charge diffuse independently. Charge and heat transport decouple in a strongly correlated electron system. Charge and heat transport decouple in a strongly correlated electron system.},

  abstract = {The first-principles density functional molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out to investigate the geometric, the electronic, and the finite temperature properties of pure Li clusters (Li10, Li12) and Al-doped Li clusters (Li10Al, Li10Al2). We find that the addition of two Al impurities in Li10 results in a substantial structural change, while the addition of one Al impurity causes a rearrangement of atoms. Introduction of Al impurities in Li10 establishes a polar bond between Li and nearby Al atom(s), leading to a multicentered bonding, which weakens the Li-Li metallic bonds in the system. These weakened Li-Li bonds lead to a premelting feature to occur at lower temperatures in Al-doped clusters. In Li10Al2, Al atoms also form a weak covalent bond, resulting in their dimerlike behavior. This causes Al atoms not to ``melt'' until 800 K, in contrast to the Li atoms which show a complete diffusive behavior above 400 K. Thus, although one Al impurity in Li10 cluster does not change its melting characteristics significantly, two impurities results in ``surface melting'' of Li atoms whose motions are confined around an Al dimer.},

  abstract = {The staggered alignment of quasi-particle energy levels is widely regarded to be the key criterion necessary for electron-hole charge separation to occur at heterogeneous material interfaces. However, staggered energy levels at nano-scale interfaces, such as those between organic molecules and inorganic quantum dots, do not necessarily imply charge separation across the interface because the excitonic effect is often significant. Using quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we perform a detailed study of the role of the excitonic effects on charge separation across a representative set of interfaces between organic molecules and quantum dots. We find that the exciton binding energy of charge transfer excitons is significantly larger than would be estimated from a simple Coulombic analysis and, at these nano-scale interfaces, can be as significant as that of Frenkel excitons. This implies that charge transfer excitons can act as a trap states for electron-hole recombination instead of facilitating charge separation. We conclude that, in general for nanoscale interfaces, high-fidelity quantum many body calculations are essential for an accurate evaluation of the detailed energetic balance between localized and delocalized excitons and are thus crucial for the predictive treatment of interfacial charge separation processes.},

The standard model of orbital physics is the Kugel\textendash Khomskii model, which first explained the symmetry of orbital and magnetic order in KCuF3 and has since been applied to virtually all orbitally active materials. Here we present Raman and X-ray scattering measurements showing that KCuF3 exhibits a previously unidentified structural phase transition at T=50 K, involving rotations of the CuF6 octahedra. These rotations are quasi-ordered and exhibit glassy hysteresis, but serve to stabilize N\'eel spin order at T=39 K. We propose an explanation for these effects by supplementing the Kugel\textendash Khomskii model with a direct, orbital exchange term that is driven by a combination of electron\textendash electron interactions and ligand distortions. The effect of this term is to create a near degeneracy that dynamically frustrates the spin subsystem but is lifted at low temperature by subdominant, orbital\textendash lattice interactions. Our results suggest that direct orbital exchange may be crucial for the physics of many orbitally active materials, including manganites, ruthenates and the iron pnictides.},

It is primarily an extended account of results obtained over the last four years by the authors; while they try to provide some background for orientation, it is emphatically not intended as a comprehensive review of the literature on the subject. Its contents include (1) an exact and general prescription for the reduction, under appropriate circumstances, of the problem of a system tunneling between two wells in the presence of a dissipative environment to the "spin-boson" problem; (2) the derivation of an exact formula for the dynamics of the latter problem; (3) the demonstration that there exists a simple approximation to this exact formula which is controlled, in the sense that we can put explicit bounds on the errors incurred in it, and that for almost all regions of the parameter space these errors are either very small in the limit of interest to us (the "slow-tunneling" limit) or can themselves be evaluated with satisfactory accuracy; (4) use of these results to obtain quantitative expressions for the dynamics of the system as a function of the spectral density J({$\omega$}) of its coupling to the environment. If J({$\omega$}) behaves as {$\omega$}s for frequencies of the order of the tunneling frequency or smaller, the authors find for the "unbiased" case the following results: For s{$<$}1 the system is localized at zero temperature, and at finite T relaxes incoherently at a rate proportional to exp-(T0T)1-s.

  abstract = {As has been shown by previous research, students may possess various misconceptions in the area of thermal physics. In order to help them overcome misconceptions observed prior to instruction, we implemented a one-hour lecture-based intervention in their introductory thermal physics course. The intervention was held after the conventional lectures and homework sessions, and it consisted of three phases: individual working, hinting, and peer discussion. To probe students' conceptual understanding before, during, and after the intervention, use was made of a diagnostic test related to the multiphased process of an ideal gas [D. E. Meltzer, Am. J. Phys. 72, 1432 (2004)]. The students' conceptions were monitored by analyzing the explanations they provided and by recording the peer discussions of five voluntary pairs. The intervention helped students to realize the flaws in their explanations and increased the proportion of their scientific explanations, the increase being statistically significant in five tasks out of seven. When the same themes were addressed in a post-test, it was shown that the level of accurate explanations remained almost constant after the intervention, and hence it could be deduced that the impact had not been short-lived. In comparison with earlier studies conducted with the same material, our intervention produced a better learning outcome, the difference being 15\textendash 20 percentage points. In addition, the number of misconceptions on the part of the students was smaller in our study, although with individual exceptions. Hence, we conclude that the intervention was successful and that similar interventions could also be designed and implemented in other areas of physics.},

The students' explanations and reasoning were investigated with the aid of paper and pencil tests (n = 86) and semi-structured interviews (n = 5) at the start of a thermal physics course at the University of Eastern Finland. The paper and pencil test revealed that the students had difficulties in applying content taught during earlier education in a new context: only a few of them were able to produce a correct explanation for the phenomenon. A majority of the students used either explanations with invalid but physically correct models, such as the ideal gas law or a microscopic model, or erroneous dependencies between quantities. The results also indicated that students had problems in seeing deficiencies or inconsistencies in their reasoning, in both test and interview situations. We suggest in our conclusion that the contents of upper secondary school thermal physics courses should be carefully examined to locate the best emphases for different laws, principles, concepts, and models. In particular, the limitations of models should be made explicit in teaching and students should be guided towards critical scientific thinking, including metaconceptual awareness.},

Information and experience about this question is implicitly available in the computational community, scattered over two decades of literature. The present review aims to summarize and quantify this implicit knowledge. This eventually leads to a practical protocol that allows any scientist\textemdash experimental or theoretical\textemdash to determine justifiable error estimates for many basic property predictions, without having to perform additional DFT calculations. A central role is played by a large and diverse test set of crystalline solids, containing all ground-state elemental crystals (except most lanthanides). For several properties of each crystal, the difference between DFT results and experimental values is assessed. We discuss trends in these deviations and review explanations suggested in the literature. A prerequisite for such an error analysis is that different implementations of the same first-principles formalism provide the same predictions. Therefore, the reproducibility of predictions across several mainstream methods and codes is discussed too. A quality factor {$\Delta$} expresses the spread in predictions from two distinct DFT implementations by a single number. To compare the PAW method to the highly accurate APW+lo approach, a code assessment of VASP and GPAW (PAW) with respect to WIEN2k (APW+lo) yields {$\Delta$}-values of 1.9 and 3.3 meV/atom, respectively. In both cases the PAW potentials recommended by the respective codes have been used. These differences are an order of magnitude smaller than the typical difference with experiment, and therefore predictions by APW+lo and PAW are for practical purposes identical.},

The films were incorporated in a field effect transistor configuration to study the control of superconductivity by electrostatic charging. While devices using STO as both the substrate and gate dielectric have produced only small Tc shifts, a clear transition between superconducting and insulating behaviour was realized using an electronic double layer transistor employing the ionic liquid DEME-TFSI as a gate dielectric. Employing a finite size scaling analysis, curves of resistance vs. temperature were found to collapse into two branches over the temperature range from 6 K to 22K suggesting the existence of a quantum critical point. However the scaling failed at temperatures below this range, indicating the possible presence of an additional phase between the superconducting and insulating regimes. Further depletion of holes appears to result in the accumulation of electrons resulting in a change of the majority carriers from holes to electrons and the emergence of what appears to be very weak re-entrant superconductivity. By changing the polarity of the gate voltage, an underdoped film was tuned into the overdoped regime by accumulating additional holes. An unexpected two-step mechanism for electrostatic doping was revealed. Hall effect measurements exhibited anomalous features, which suggest the occurrence of an electronic phase transition near optimal doping.},

The model consists of local spin moments on each Fe site, as well as itinerant electrons from the degenerate dxz and dyz orbitals. The local moments interact with each other through antiferromagnetic J1-J2 Heisenberg interactions, and they couple to the itinerant electrons through a ferromagnetic Hund coupling. We employ the fermionic spinon representation for the local moments and perform a generalized random-phase approximation calculation on both spinons and itinerant electrons. We find that in the ({$\pi$},0) magnetically ordered state, the spin-wave excitation at ({$\pi$},{$\pi$}) is pushed to a higher energy due to the presence of itinerant electrons, which is consistent with a previous study using the Holstein-Primakoff transformation. In the paramagnetic state, the particle-hole continuum keeps the collective spin excitation near ({$\pi$},{$\pi$}) at a higher energy even without any C4 symmetry breaking. The implications for recent high-temperature neutron scattering measurements will be discussed.},

An anomalous anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect occurs close to the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in the system, showing a direct correlation with the anisotropic field-tuned MIT in the system and can be understood by means of a simple phenomenological model. A small crystalline anisotropy stimulates a ``colossal'' AMR near the MIT phase boundary of the system, thus revealing the intimate interplay between magneto- and electronic-crystalline couplings.},

Determining the pressure-temperature phase diagram of hydrogen is challenging for experiment and theory due to the extreme conditions and the required accuracy in the quantum mechanical treatment of the constituent electrons and nuclei, respectively. Here, we demonstrate explicitly that coupled cluster theory can serve as a computationally efficient theoretical tool to predict solid hydrogen phases with high accuracy. We present a first principles study of solid hydrogen phases at pressures ranging from 100 to 450 GPa. The computed static lattice enthalpies are compared to state-of-the-art diffusion Monte Carlo results and density functional theory calculations.

Our method of extending a molecular neural network to periodic systems can be easily integrated into other neural network structures, highlighting a promising future of ab initio solution of more complex solid systems using neural network ansatz, and more generally endorsing the application of machine learning in materials simulation and condensed matter physics.},

  abstract = {Concentrations of the Si-H vibration bond and the dangling bond in amorphous silicon films were studied using FTIR and ESR techniques respectively as a function of annealing temperature in the range from 20degC to 950degC. It was found that the concentration of Si-H did not change much for temperatures up to 350degC and then dropped monotonically and became negligible at temperatures above 850degC, while the concentration of SiH2 increased with temperature and attained a maximum at 450degC and then decreased with temperature there after. The ESR signal dropped with temperature, up to 200degC, and fell below the detection limit of our spectrometer in the range 200degC-500degC. The ESR signal recovered when annealing temperature was higher than 550degC. The Si-H, SiH2, ESR and optical absorption signals were found to be highly correlated to each other and could be interpreted in a consistent manner.},

Density functional theory calculations reveal that a hybrid state is formed between the two types of phthalocyanines, which causes this charge transfer. For the hybrid state the Mn 3dxz interacts with the Co 3dz2 orbital leading to a two-level system. As only the lower of the two hybrid states is occupied, the charge is directly transferred to the Co 3dz2 orbital.},

  abstract = {We report measurements of the diffusion of atomic hydrogen in single crystalline VO2 micro/nanobeams by direct exposure to atomic hydrogen, without catalyst. The atomic hydrogen is generated by a hot filament, and the doping process takes place at moderate temperature (373 K). Undoped VO2 has a metal-to-insulator phase transition at ?340 K between a high-temperature, rutile, metallic phase and a low-temperature, monoclinic, insulating phase with a resistance exhibiting a semiconductor-like temperature dependence. Atomic hydrogenation results in stabilization of the metallic phase of VO2 micro/nanobeams down to 2 K, the lowest point we could reach in our measurement setup. Optical characterization shows that hydrogen atoms prefer to diffuse along the c axis of rutile (a axis of monoclinic) VO2, along the oxygen ?channels?. Based on observing the movement of the hydrogen diffusion front in single crystalline VO2 beams, we estimate the diffusion constant for hydrogen along the c axis of the rutile phase to be 6.7 ? 10?10 cm2/s at approximately 373 K, exceeding the value in isostructural TiO2 by ?38?. Moreover, we find that the diffusion constant along the c axis of the rutile phase exceeds that along the equivalent a axis of the monoclinic phase by at least 3 orders of magnitude. This remarkable change in kinetics must originate from the distortion of the ?channels? when the unit cell doubles along this direction upon cooling into the monoclinic structure. Ab initio calculation results are in good agreement with the experimental trends in the relative kinetics of the two phases. This raises the possibility of a switchable membrane for hydrogen transport.},

According to one distinct theoretical proposal, on decreasing the hole-carrier concentration a transition occurs to an ordered state with two circulating orbital currents per CuO2 square. Below the `pseudogap' temperature T*(T*{$>$}Tc), the theory predicts a discrete order parameter and two weakly-dispersive magnetic excitations in structurally simple compounds which should be measurable by neutron scattering. Indeed, novel magnetic order and one such excitation were recently observed. Here, we demonstrate for tetragonal HgBa2CuO4+{$\delta$} the existence of a second excitation with local character, consistent with the theory. The excitations mix with conventional antiferromagnetic fluctuations, which points towards a unifying picture of magnetism in the cuprates that will probably require a multi-band description.

The root source of the anisotropy was visualized as the formation of a peculiar unidirectional stripe state which accompanies the phase transition. Furthermore, nanoscale infrared spectroscopy unveils distinct facets of electron-lattice interplay at three different stages of the phase transition. These stages include the initial formation of sparse nonpercolating metallic domains without noticeable involvement of the lattice followed by an electron-lattice coupled anisotropic stripe state close to percolation which ultimately evolves into a nearly isotropic rutile metallic phase. Our results provide a unique mesoscopic perspective for the tunable macroscopic phenomena in strained metal oxide films.},

This has allowed us to investigate the evolution of ab-plane charge dynamics at doping levels ranging from heavily underdoped to nearly optimally doped. Our results of the low-frequency optical conductivity and spectral weight do not show any features associated with the normal-state pseudogap. Instead, one-component analysis for the optical conductivity shows the low-frequency depression in the scattering rate at , signalling entry into the pseudogap state. Alternatively, no clear indications of the normal-state pseudogap are detected in the temperature-dependent zero-frequency free-carrier scattering rate by using two-component analysis. In the superconducting state, there is also no convincing evidence of superconducting gap absorption in all spectra. We find that there is a `universal correlation' between the numbers of carriers and the transition temperature.

Calorimetry signatures of both the structural phase transition and melting of nanoconfined LiBH4 shifted to a lower temperature with respect to the bulk, finally vanishing below a pore size around 4 nm. The desorption of LiBH4 confined in these nanoporous carbons shows a systematic and monotonic decrease in the desorption temperature and concomitantly, mass spectroscopic analysis indicated a gradual reduction of the partial pressure of B2H6 with decreasing pore size, suggesting that formation of stable closoborane salts may be avoided by interrupting the reaction pathway. This represents a major breakthrough in the reversibility of boron-based hydrogen storage systems, where capacity is lost in the formation of stable B-H species on cycling. Different carbon preparation techniques suggest that the confinement size, and not solely surface interactions, may be used to tune the properties of complex hydrides for kinetic and reaction pathway improvements for hydrogen storage applications.},

  abstract = {Electron\textendash electron interactions can render an otherwise conducting material insulating, with the insulator\textendash metal phase transition in correlated-electron materials being the canonical macroscopic manifestation of the competition between charge-carrier itinerancy and localization. The transition can arise from underlying microscopic interactions among the charge, lattice, orbital and spin degrees of freedom, the complexity of which leads to multiple phase-transition pathways. For example, in many transition metal oxides, the insulator\textendash metal transition has been achieved with external stimuli, including temperature, light, electric field, mechanical strain or magnetic field. Vanadium dioxide is particularly intriguing because both the lattice and on-site Coulomb repulsion contribute to the insulator-to-metal transition at 340 K (ref. 8). Thus, although the precise microscopic origin of the phase transition remains elusive, vanadium dioxide serves as a testbed for correlated-electron phase-transition dynamics. Here we report the observation of an insulator\textendash metal transition in vanadium dioxide induced by a terahertz electric field. This is achieved using metamaterial-enhanced picosecond, high-field terahertz pulses to reduce the Coulomb-induced potential barrier for carrier transport. A nonlinear metamaterial response is observed through the phase transition, demonstrating that high-field terahertz pulses provide alternative pathways to induce collective electronic and structural rearrangements. The metamaterial resonators play a dual role, providing sub-wavelength field enhancement that locally drives the nonlinear response, and global sensitivity to the local changes, thereby enabling macroscopic observation of the dynamics. This methodology provides a powerful platform to investigate low-energy dynamics in condensed matter and, further, demonstrates that integration of metamaterials with complex matter is a viable pathway to realize functional nonlinear electromagnetic composites.},

  abstract = {This review discusses instabilities of the Fermi-liquid state of conduction electrons in metals with particular emphasis on magnetic quantum critical points. Both existing theoretical concepts and experimental data on selected materials are presented; with the aim of assessing the validity of presently available theory. After briefly recalling the fundamentals of Fermi-liquid theory, the local Fermi-liquid state in quantum impurity models and their lattice versions is described. Next, the scaling concepts applicable to quantum phase transitions are presented. The Hertz-Millis-Moriya theory of quantum phase transitions is described in detail. The breakdown of the latter is analyzed in several examples. In the final part, experimental data on heavy-fermion materials and transition-metal alloys are reviewed and confronted with existing theory.},

Single photon emission from various defect centers in both bulk and nanostructured SiC are discussed as well as their formation and possible integration into optical and electrical devices. The related measurement protocols, the building blocks of quantum communication and computation network architectures in solid state systems, are also summarized. This includes experimental methodologies developed for spin control of different paramagnetic defects, including the measurement of spin coherence times. Well established doping, and micro- and nanofabrication procedures for SiC may allow the quantum properties of paramagnetic defects to be electrically and mechanically controlled efficiently. The integration of single defects into SiC devices is crucial for applications in quantum technologies and we will review progress in this direction.},

  abstract = {The random first-order transition (RFOT) theory of the structural glass transition is reviewed in a pedagogical fashion. The rigidity that emerges in crystals and glassy liquids is of the same fundamental origin. In both cases, it corresponds with a breaking of the translational symmetry; analogies with freezing transitions in spin systems can also be made. The common aspect of these seemingly distinct phenomena is a spontaneous emergence of the molecular field, a venerable and well-understood concept. In crucial distinction from periodic crystallisation, the free energy landscape of a glassy liquid is vastly degenerate, which gives rise to new length and time scales while rendering the emergence of rigidity gradual. We obviate the standard notion that to be mechanically stable a structure must be essentially unique; instead, we show that bulk degeneracy is perfectly allowed but should not exceed a certain value. The present microscopic description thus explains both crystallisation and the emergence of the landscape regime followed by vitrification in a unified, thermodynamics-rooted fashion. The article contains a self-contained exposition of the basics of the classical density functional theory and liquid theory, which are subsequently used to quantitatively estimate, without using adjustable parameters, the key attributes of glassy liquids, viz., the relaxation barriers, glass transition temperature, and cooperativity size. These results are then used to quantitatively discuss many diverse glassy phenomena, including: the intrinsic connection between the excess liquid entropy and relaxation rates, the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of \$\textbackslash alpha\$-relaxation, the dynamic heterogeneity, ...

The 109 degree and 180 degree walls have a significant change in the component of their polarization perpendicular to the wall; the corresponding step in the electrostatic potential is consistent with a recent report of electrical conductivity at the domain walls. Finally, we show that changes in the Fe-O-Fe bond angles at the domain walls cause changes in the canting of the Fe magnetic moments which can enhance the local magnetization at the domain walls.},

In the paramagnetic tetragonal phase of BaFe2-xTxAs2 (where T is Co or Ni) iron pnictides, an in-plane resistivity anisotropy has been observed. Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering to show that low-energy spin excitations in these materials change from fourfold symmetric to twofold symmetric at temperatures corresponding to the onset of the in-plane resistivity anisotropy. Because resistivity and spin excitation anisotropies both vanish near optimal superconductivity, we conclude that they are likely intimately connected. Scattering neutrons asymmetrically The crystal structure of solid materials often influences their properties. The more symmetric the structure, the less dependent these properties are on the spatial direction. The superconductors that derive from the compound BaFe2As2 are an exception: Their electronic transport properties can be anisotropic even in the phase where the crystal is symmetric. By scattering neutrons off their samples, Lu et al. found that the magnetic properties of these materials can also be anisotropic. The similar temperature and doping dependence of the anisotropies of both transport and magnetic properties suggests that they may have a common cause. Science, this issue p. 657},

A displacement of the Se atom by an amount as small as 0.2 \AA{} is enough to change the amount of charge in the Fe plane by as much as 0.8 electrons per Fe. The height of the Se atom above the Fe square increases as the number of ferromagnetic Fe-Fe bonds increases, yielding an expansion of 2 \AA{} in the c axis for the fully ferromagnetic spin configuration, which suggests the presence of a giant magnetoelastic coupling in this system. Interestingly, the strong coupling between the Se height and the spin configuration of the underlying Fe square is found to be rather local, such that both the energetics and the structural parameters of the 5--{$\surd\times$}5--{$\surd$} phase can be understood in terms of three different magnetic configurations of the ideal 122 structure. We show that the formation of Fe vacancies is energetically favorable and that their presence changes the ground state from double-stripe to block-antiferromagnetic ordering. The formation of K vacancies is found to be energetically unfavorable.},

  abstract = {It is shown that certain analytical properties of the propagators of many-fermion systems lead rigorously to the existence of sharp discontinuities of the momentum distribution at absolute zero. This discontinuity in the momentum distribution is used to define a Fermi surface for a system of interacting fermions. It is shown that the volume of this surface in momentum space is unaffected by the interaction. The same analytic properties are shown to lead, by direct statistical mechanical arguments, to simple expressions for the low-temperature heat capacity, the spin paramagnetism, and the compressibility of the system. These expressions are very analogous to the corresponding expressions for noninteracting particles. Finally, it is shown how the whole formalism may be generalized when an external periodic potential is present (band case).},

The corresponding many-electron, Shannon-like measure reflects quantum entanglement between electronic subsystems with different spins. The related Renyi entropy is introduced, and its connection with the previously considered collectivity analysis is discussed. Investigation of the second-order reduced density matrix (2-RDM) allows one to define an irreducible, size-consistent component of the 2-RDM entropy and to find the irreducible component of the 2-RDM squared norm. Specific computations on several small molecules are carried out at the full configuration interaction level, providing new insights into non-classical, long-range electron correlations and quantum entanglement in these systems. The local spin analysis and the spin-correlator analysis reveal nontrivial spin structure underlying the entangled states.},

  abstract = {Information Physics Multiparameter models, which can emerge in biology and other disciplines, are often sensitive to only a small number of parameters and robust to changes in the rest; approaches from information theory can be used to distinguish between the two parameter groups. In physics, on the other hand, one does not need to know the details at smaller length and time scales in order to understand the behavior on large scales. This hierarchy has been recognized for a long time and formalized within the renormalization group (RG) approach. Machta et al. (p. 604) explored the connection between two scales by using an information-theoretical approach based on the Fisher Information Matrix to analyze two commonly used physics models\textemdash diffusion in one dimension and the Ising model of magnetism\textemdash as the time and length scales, respectively, were progressively coarsened. The expected ``stiff'' parameters emerged, in agreement with RG intuition. The microscopically complicated real world exhibits behavior that often yields to simple yet quantitatively accurate descriptions. Predictions are possible despite large uncertainties in microscopic parameters, both in physics and in multiparameter models in other areas of science. We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion) and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally. An information-theoretical approach is used to distinguish the important parameters in two archetypical physics models.

A significant fraction of the carriers remains uncondensed in a wide Drude-like peak even as \$T\textbackslash rightarrow0\$, which, when taken with the linear-in-temperature superfluid density, is inconsistent with existing theories for the role of disorder in suppressing the superfluid density in a d-wave superconductor. Our almost eight orders of magnitude in measurement frequency range gives us a unique look at the low frequency spectral weight distribution, which may suggest the presence of quantum phase fluctuations as the critical doping is approached.},

We consider ionic clusters of AlH3, NaH, and NaAlH4 and include as decomposition products metallic clusters of Na, Al, and mixed Na-Al. Small clusters of Na3AlH6 are found to be unstable because of a Jahn-Teller distortion that destabilizes the constituent [AlH6]3- anions and causes them to split into two H- ions and [AlH4]-. Cluster geometries for ionic clusters were obtained by relaxing prototype electrostatic ground state (PEGS) structures using density-functional theory calculations; vibrational free energy was also calculated for each of the clusters. We find that small clusters of AlH3 increase in stability with smaller cluster size from enthalpies of around 51 to 160 kJ/mol H2 for eight and one formula unit (fu), respectively. In contrast, small clusters of NaH have an enthalpy of decomposition of about 70 kJ/mol H2 and show no destabilization with size until the cluster is two formula units or smaller when they spontaneously decompose. Clusters of NaAlH4 also show increasing stability with decreasing cluster size with an enthalpy of decomposition that increases from 80 kJ/mol H2 for eight fu clusters to 150 kJ/mol H2 for 1 fu clusters. NaAlH4 clusters are found to decompose directly into mixed Al-Na clusters in one step, which is in agreement with recent experimental work on NaAlH4 in nanoporous carbons. Finally, we predict destabilized reactions involving simple hydride (NaH and AlH3) and complex hydride (NaAlH4) nanoclusters that have lower critical temperatures than either of the reactants.},

Our approach is based on global optimization of an energy functional consisting of the electrostatic and soft-sphere repulsive energies using Metropolis Monte Carlo (MMC) simulated annealing in conjunction with smoothing of the potential energy landscape via the distance scaling method. The resulting structures, or prototype electrostatic ground states (PEGS), are subsequently relaxed using first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain accurate structural parameters and thermodynamic properties. This method is shown to produce the ground state structures of NaAlH4 and Mg(AlH4)2, as well as the mixed cation alanate K2LiAlH6. For LiAlH4, the PEGS search produces a structure with a static DFT total energy equal to that of the experimentally observed structure; the latter is stabilized by vibrational contributions to the free energy. For mixed-valence hexa-alanates, XY AlH6, where X=(Li,Na,K), and Y=(Mg,Ca), the PEGS method predicts six unsuspected structure types, which are not found in the existing structure databases. The PEGS search yields energies that are, on the average, better than the best database structures with the same number of atoms per unit cell, demonstrating the predictive power and usefulness of the PEGS structures. In addition to the recently synthesized LiMgAlH6 compound, we predict that LiCaAlH6, NaCaAlH6, and KCaAlH6 are also thermodynamically stable with respect to phase separation into other alanates and metal hydrides. In contrast, NaMgAlH6 and KMgAlH6 are slightly unstable (by less than 3 kJ/mol) relative to the phase separation into NaAlH4, KAlH4, and MgH2. We suggest that solid-state ion-exchange reactions between X3AlH6 (X=Li,Na,K) and YCl2 (Y=Mg,Ca) could be used to synthesize the predicted mixed-valence hexa-alanates.},

For aperiodic systems the exact electrostatic energy functional in periodic boundary conditions is obtained. The convergence in such systems is considered in the limit of large supercells, where, in the gas phase, the computational effort is proportional to the volume. It is shown that for neutral localized aperiodic systems in either the gas or condensed phases, the energy can always be made to converge as O(L-5) where L is the linear dimension of the supercell. For charged systems, convergence at this rate can be achieved after adding correction terms to the energy to account for spurious interactions induced by the periodic boundary conditions.

With a dictionary of Gabor functions a matching pursuit defines an adaptive time-frequency transform. They derive a signal energy distribution in the time-frequency plane, which does not include interference terms, unlike Wigner and Cohen class distributions. A matching pursuit isolates the signal structures that are coherent with respect to a given dictionary. An application to pattern extraction from noisy signals is described.

We apply the strategy to the LiH crystal, using the MP2 and CCSD(T) schemes for the correlation energy, and show that for this material Ecoh can be obtained to an accuracy of [similar]30 meV per ion pair.

Superconductivity in FeSe shows a very strong sensitivity to pressure, with an increase in Tc of almost a factor of 5 within a few GPa, followed by a drop, despite monotonic pressure dependence of almost all electronic properties. We find that the maximum A1g deformation potential behaves similar to the experimental Tc. In contrast, the maximum deformation potential in DFT for this mode increases monotonically with increasing pressure.},

This topical review examines recent progress in this area, with particular emphasis on the implication of experimental data which have provided evidence for the presence of electron itinerancy and the detection of local spin moments. In light of the results presented, the necessity of a theoretical framework contemplating the presence and the interplay between itinerant electrons and large spin moments is discussed. It is argued that the physics at the heart of the macroscopic properties of pnictides Fe-based high-temperature superconductors appears to be far more complex and interesting than initially predicted.},

To assess the ever-increasing number of approximate exchange-correlation functionals, this review benchmarks a total of 200 density functionals on a molecular database (MGCDB84) of nearly 5000 data points. The database employed, provided as Supplemental Data, is comprised of 84 data-sets and contains non-covalent interactions, isomerisation energies, thermochemistry, and barrier heights. In addition, the evolution of non-empirical and semi-empirical density functional design is reviewed, and guidelines are provided for the proper and effective use of density functionals. The most promising functional considered is {$\omega$}B97M-V, a range-separated hybrid meta-GGA with VV10 nonlocal correlation, designed using a combinatorial approach. From the local GGAs, B97-D3, revPBE-D3, and BLYP-D3 are recommended, while from the local meta-GGAs, B97M-rV is the leading choice, followed by MS1-D3 and M06-L-D3. The best hybrid GGAs are {$\omega$}B97X-V, {$\omega$}B97X-D3, and {$\omega$}B97X-D, while useful hybrid meta-GGAs (besides {$\omega$}B97M-V) include {$\omega$}M05-D, M06-2X-D3, and MN15. Ultimately, today's state-of-the-art functionals are close to achieving the level of accuracy desired for a broad range of chemical applications, and the principal remaining limitations are associated with systems that exhibit significant self-interaction/delocalisation errors and/or strong correlation effects.},

We find that the application of hydrostatic pressure first rapidly increases Tc which attains a broad maximum of 37 K at {$\sim$}7 GPa before decreasing to 6 K upon further compression to {$\sim$}14 GPa. Complementary synchrotron x-ray diffraction at 16 K was used to measure the low-temperature isothermal compressibility of {$\alpha$}-FeSe, revealing an extremely soft solid with a bulk modulus, K0=30.7(1.1) GPa and strong bonding anisotropy between interlayer and intralayer directions that transforms to the more densely packed {$\beta$} polymorph above {$\sim$}9 GPa. The nonmonotonic Tc(P) behavior of FeSe coincides with drastic anomalies in the pressure evolution of the interlayer spacing, pointing to the key role of this structural feature in modulating the electronic properties.},

Having such a picture, however, could quite well be at the very roots of the requirements for understanding high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates and pnictides, for instance. In this work we consider the antiferromagnetic (AF) Heisenberg-Kondo lattice, consisting of localized spins with AF exchange interactions between nearest neighbors on a square lattice and itinerant electrons, which undergo a magnetic Kondo interaction with the localized spins, but are otherwise non-interacting. Using the Schwinger-boson (CP\$\^1\$) formalism and assuming the electrons are Dirac-like, we integrate on the localized degrees of freedom thereby obtaining the effective interaction among the itinerant electrons. This contains a BCS-like superconducting term, a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like, charge gap term and a Ising and Heisenberg-like magnetic terms. All these four competing interactions, therefore are generated by the original Kondo magnetic interaction.},

In this ansatz, the electronic wave function is represented by a Complete-Graph Tensor Network (CGTN) ansatz which implements an efficient reduction of the number of variational parameters by breaking down the complexity of the high-dimensional coefficient tensor of a full-configuration-interaction (FCI) wave function. We demonstrate that CGTN states approximate ground states of molecules accurately by comparison of the CGTN and FCI expansion coefficients. The CGTN parametrization is not biased towards any reference configuration in contrast to many standard quantum chemical methods. This feature allows one to obtain accurate relative energies between CGTN states which is central to molecular physics and chemistry. We discuss the implications for quantum chemistry and focus on the spin-state problem. Our CGTN approach is applied to the energy splitting of states of different spin for methylene and the strongly correlated ozone molecule at a transition state structure. The parameters of the tensor network ansatz are variationally optimized by means of a parallel-tempering Monte Carlo algorithm.},

The first two are well known to derive from the large Coulomb repulsion associated with the Cu 3d orbital; it is shown that the last also follows from this fact. It is furthermore demonstrated that more sophisticated three-band models, when studied in the parameter regime believed to be appropriate to these materials, also exhibit this tendency toward localization. It is stressed that this feature is a consequence of the strong rehybridization and resulting reduction of the kinetic and Coulomb energies, accompanying the introduction of two holes on a single CuO6 unit. \textcopyright{} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

In this work, we demonstrate the importance of collective van der Waals dispersion effects beyond the pairwise approximation for organic\textendash inorganic systems on the example of atoms, molecules, and nanostructures adsorbed on metals. We use the recently developed many-body dispersion (MBD) approach in the context of density-functional theory [Tkatchenko et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 236402 (2012) and Ambrosetti et al., J. Chem. Phys. 140, 18A508 (2014)] and assess its ability to correctly describe the binding of adsorbates on metal surfaces. We briefly review the MBD method and highlight its similarities to quantum-chemical approaches to electron correlation in a quasiparticle picture. In particular, we study the binding properties of xenon, 3,4,9,10-perylene-tetracarboxylic acid, and a graphene sheet adsorbed on the Ag(111) surface. Accounting for MBD effects, we are able to describe changes in the anisotropic polarizability tensor, improve the description of adsorbate vibrations, and correctly capture the adsorbate\textendash surface interaction screening. Comparison to other methods and experiment reveals that inclusion of MBD effects improves adsorption energies and geometries, by reducing the overbinding typically found in pairwise additive dispersion-correction approaches.},

Our first-principles DFT-derived tight-binding model reveal that a combination of spatial localization of the conduction and valance bands and Rashba-like spin-orbit coupling leads to a gating induced spin-splitting of the 2D-bulk bands in the tens of meV, thereby reducing the band gap.

Iron has the ability to adopt different electronic configurations, and transitions in its spin state in the lower mantle can significantly influence mantle properties and dynamics. However, previous studies aimed at understanding these transitions have provided conflicting results. Here we report the results of high-pressure (up to 110 GPa) and high-temperature (up to 1,000 K) experiments aimed at understanding spin transitions of iron in perovskite at lower-mantle conditions. Our M\"ossbauer and nuclear forward scattering data for two lower-mantle perovskite compositions demonstrate that the transition of ferrous iron from the high-spin to the intermediate-spin state occurs at approximately 30 GPa, and that high temperatures favour the stability of the intermediate-spin state. We therefore infer that ferrous iron adopts the intermediate-spin state throughout the bulk of the lower mantle. Our X-ray data show significant anisotropic compression of lower-mantle perovskite containing intermediate-spin ferrous iron, which correlates strongly with the spin transition. We predict spin-state heterogeneities in the uppermost part of the lower mantle associated with sinking slabs and regions of upwelling. These may affect local properties, including thermal and electrical conductivity, deformation (viscosity) and chemical behaviour, and thereby affect mantle dynamics.},

The QMCS has been most thoroughly tested in, and is most appropriate for assessment of (as a posttest only), sophomore-level modern physics courses. We also describe testing with students in junior quantum courses and graduate quantum courses, from which we conclude that the QMCS may be appropriate for assessing junior quantum courses, but is not appropriate for assessing graduate courses. One surprising result of our faculty interviews is a lack of faculty consensus on what topics should be taught in modern physics, which has made designing a test that is valued by a majority of physics faculty more difficult than expected.},

The method generates numerical Wannier functions for the relevant states, and by decoupling these functions, permits direct calculation of the individual parameters. We have tested this method for the cuprate La2CuO4, and obtained values for the Cu(3d2x-y2) and O(2p{$\sigma$}) parameters in general agreement with previous empirical and theoretical estimates. These calculations provide even-handed treatment of both Cu(3d) and the more extended O(2p) states, and yield the important difference {$\varepsilon$}p({$\sigma$})-{$\varepsilon$}2d(x-y2) consistent with expectations based on the superexchange frequency. We also report parameter values for the Cu(3d23z-r2) states, and for compatible O(2p) states, which may be of use in theoretical attempts to confirm the symmetry of the doped-in carriers.},

Unlike atoms, the superatom orbitals span over multiple atoms and the filling of orbitals does not usually exhibit Hund's rule seen in atoms. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of enhancing exchange splitting in superatom shells via a composite cluster of a central transition metal and surrounding nearly free electron metal atoms. The transition metal d states hybridize with superatom D states and result in enhanced splitting between the majority and minority sets where the moment and the splitting can be controlled by the nature of the central atom. We demonstrate these findings through studies on TMMgn clusters where TM is a 3d atom. The clusters exhibit Hund's filling, opening the pathway to superatoms with magnetic shells.},

The continuing development of density functional theory (DFT) has greatly expanded the size and complexity of molecules amenable to computationally tractable simulation. The conventional metric of success for new functionals has been the accuracy of their calculated energies. Medvedev et al. examined how well these functionals calculate electron density across a series of neutral and cationic atoms (see the Perspective by Hammes-Schiffer). Although historically the accuracies of energy and density have improved in tandem, certain recent functionals have sacrificed fidelity to the true density. Science, this issue p. 49; see also p. 28 The theorems at the core of density functional theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-electron system in its ground state is fully defined by its electron density distribution. This connection is made via the exact functional for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density. For years, DFT development focused on energies, implicitly assuming that functionals producing better energies become better approximations of the exact functional. We examined the other side of the coin: the energy-minimizing electron densities for atomic species, as produced by 128 historical and modern DFT functionals. We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained functionals sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting. Certain recent approaches to density functional theory have sacrificed fidelity to the true electron density.

Here, we report the magnetic and electronic phase diagram of -Fe1.01Se as a function of temperature and pressure. The superconducting transition temperature increases from 8.5 to 36.7 K under an applied pressure of 8.9 GPa. It then decreases at higher pressures. A marked change in volume is observed at the same time as TC rises, owing to a collapse of the separation between the Fe2Se2 layers. No static magnetic ordering is observed for the whole p\textendash T phase diagram. We also report that at higher pressures (starting around 7 GPa and completed at 38 GPa), Fe1.01Se transforms to a hexagonal NiAs-type structure and exhibits non-magnetic behaviour.},

  abstract = {The pseudogap phase occurring in cuprate and organic superconductors is analyzed based on the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) approach to the Hubbard model. A cluster embedded in a self-consistent bath is studied. With increasing Coulomb repulsion, U, the antinodal point [k=(pi,0)] displays a gradual suppression of spectral density of states around the Fermi energy which is not observed at the nodal point [k=(pi/2,pi/2)]. The opening of the antinodal pseudogap is related to the internal structure of the cluster and the much weaker bath-cluster couplings at the antinodal than nodal point. The role played by internal cluster correlations is elucidated from a simple four-level model. For small U, the cluster levels form Kondo singlets with their baths leading to a peak in the spectral density. As U is increased a localized state is formed localizing the electrons in the cluster. If this cluster localized state is non-degenerate, the Kondo effect is destroyed and a pseudogap opens up in the spectra at the anti-nodal point. The pseudogap can be understood in terms of destructive interference between different paths for electrons hopping between the cluster and the bath. However, electrons at the nodal points remain in Kondo states up to larger U since they are more strongly coupled to the bath. The strong correlation between the (pi,0) and (0,pi) cluster levels in the localized state leads to a large correlation energy gain which is important for localizing electrons and opening up a pseudogap. Such scenario is in contrast with two independent Mott transitions found in two-band systems with different bandwidths in which the localized cluster electron does not correlate strongly with any other cluster electron for intermediate U. The important intracluster sector correlations are associated with the resonating valence bond (RVB) character of the cluster.},

  abstract = {While charge density wave (CDW) instabilities are ubiquitous to superconducting cuprates, the different ordering wave vectors in various cuprate families have hampered a unified description of the CDW formation mechanism. Here, we investigate the temperature dependence of the low-energy phonons in the canonical CDW-ordered cuprate La1.875Ba0.125CuO4. We discover that the phonon softening wave vector associated with CDW correlations becomes temperature dependent in the high-temperature precursor phase and changes from a wave vector of 0.238 reciprocal lattice units (r.l.u.) below the ordering transition temperature to 0.3 r.l.u. at 300 K. This high-temperature behavior shows that ``214''-type cuprates can host CDW correlations at a similar wave vector to previously reported CDW correlations in non-214-type cuprates such as YBa2Cu3O6+{$\delta$}. This indicates that cuprate CDWs may arise from the same underlying instability despite their apparently different low-temperature ordering wave vectors.},

  abstract = {v0.9.0 (July 2018) Note: a version of these release notes with working links appears in the online documentation. This is a major release with several substantial and long-desired new features. There are also updates/modifications to the themes and color palettes that give better consistency with matplotlib 2.0 and some notable API changes. New relational plots Three completely new plotting functions have been added: catplot, scatterplot, and lineplot. The first is a figure-level interface to the latter two that combines them with a FacetGrid. The functions bring the high-level, dataset-oriented API of the seaborn categorical plotting functions to more general plots (scatter plots and line plots). These functions can visualize a relationship between two numeric variables while mapping up to three additional variables by modifying hue, size, and/or style semantics. The common high-level API is implemented differently in the two functions. For example, the size semantic in scatterplot scales the area of scatter plot points, but in lineplot it scales width of the line plot lines. The API is dataset-oriented, meaning that in both cases you pass the variable in your dataset rather than directly specifying the matplotlib parameters to use for point area or line width. Another way the relational functions differ from existing seaborn functionality is that they have better support for using numeric variables for hue and size semantics. This functionality may be propagated to other functions that can add a hue semantic in future versions; it has not been in this release. The lineplot function also has support for statistical estimation and is replacing the older tsplot function, which still exists but is marked for removal in a future release. lineplot is better aligned with the API of the rest of the library and more flexible in showing relationships across additional variables by modifying the size and style semantics independently. It also has substantially improved support for date and time data, a major pain factor in tsplot. The cost is that some of the more esoteric options in tsplot for representing uncertainty (e.g. a colormapped KDE of the bootstrap distribution) have not been implemented in the new function. There is quite a bit of new documentation that explains these new functions in more detail, including detailed examples of the various options in the API reference and a more verbose tutorial. These functions should be considered in a "stable beta" state. They have been thoroughly tested, but some unknown corner cases may remain to be found. The main features are in place, but not all planned functionality has been implemented. There are planned improvements to some elements, particularly the default legend, that are a little rough around the edges in this release. Finally, some of the default behavior (e.g. the default range of point/line sizes) may change somewhat in future releases. Updates to themes and palettes Several changes have been made to the seaborn style themes, context scaling, and color palettes. In general the aim of these changes was to make the seaborn styles more consistent with the style updates in matplotlib 2.0 and to leverage some of the new style parameters for better implementation of some aspects of the seaborn styles. Here is a list of the changes: Reorganized and updated some axes\_style/plotting\_context parameters to take advantage of improvements in the matplotlib 2.0 update. The biggest change involves using several new parameterss in the "style" spec while moving parameters that used to implement the corresponding aesthetics to the "context" spec. For example, axes spines and ticks are now off instead of having their width/length zeroed out for the darkgrid style. That means the width/length of these elements can now be scaled in different contexts. The effect is a more cohesive appearance of the plots, especially in larger contexts. These changes include only minimal support for the 1.x matplotlib series. Users who are stuck on matplotlib 1.5 but wish to use seaborn styling may want to use the seaborn parameters that can be accessed through the matplotlib stylesheet interface. Updated the seaborn palettes ("deep", "muted", "colorblind", etc.) to correspond with the new 10-color matplotlib default. The legacy palettes are now available at "deep6", "muted6", "colorblind6", etc. Additionally, a few individual colors were tweaked for better consistency, aesthetics, and accessibility. Calling color\_palette (or set\_palette) with a named qualitative palettes (i.e. one of the seaborn palettes, the colorbrewer qualitative palettes, or the matplotlib matplotlib tableau-derived palettes) and no specified number of colors will return all of the colors in the palette. This means that for some palettes, the returned list will have a different length than it did in previous versions. Enhanced color\_palette to accept a parameterized specification of a cubehelix palette in in a string, prefixed with "ch:" (e.g. "ch:-.1,.2,l=.7"). Note that keyword arguments can be spelled out or referenced using only their first letter. Reversing the palette is accomplished by appending "\_r", as with other matplotlib colormaps. This specification will be accepted by any seaborn function with a palette= parameter. Slightly increased the base font sizes in plotting\_context and increased the scaling factors for "talk" and "poster" contexts. Calling set will now call set\_color\_codes to re-assign the single letter color codes by default API changes A few functions have been renamed or have had changes to their default parameters. The factorplot function has been renamed to catplot. The new name ditches the original R-inflected terminology to use a name that is more consistent with terminology in pandas and in seaborn itself. This change should hopefully make catplot easier to discover, and it should make more clear what its role is. factorplot still exists and will pass its arguments through to catplot with a warning. It may be removed eventually, but the transition will be as gradual as possible. The other reason that the factorplot name was changed was to ease another alteration which is that the default kind in catplot is now "strip" (corresponding to stripplot). This plots a categorical scatter plot which is usually a much better place to start and is more consistent with the default in relplot. The old default style in factorplot ("point", corresponding to pointplot) remains available if you want to show a statistical estimation. The lvplot function has been renamed to boxenplot. The "letter-value" terminology that was used to name the original kind of plot is obscure, and the abbreviation to lv did not help anything. The new name should make the plot more discoverable by describing its format (it plots multiple boxes, also known as "boxen"). As with factorplot, the lvplot function still exists to provide a relatively smooth transition. Renamed the size parameter to height in multi-plot grid objects (FacetGrid, PairGrid, and JointGrid) along with functions that use them (factorplot, lmplot, pairplot, and jointplot) to avoid conflicts with the size parameter that is used in scatterplot and lineplot (necessary to make relplot work) and also makes the meaning of the parameter a bit more clear. Changed the default diagonal plots in pairplot to use `func`:kdeplot` when a "hue" dimension is used. Deprecated the statistical annotation component of JointGrid. The method is still available but will be removed in a future version. Two older functions that were deprecated in earlier versions, coefplot and interactplot, have undergone final removal from the code base. Documentation improvements There has been some effort put into improving the documentation. The biggest change is that the introduction to the library has been completely rewritten to provide much more information and, critically, examples. In addition to the high-level motivation, the introduction also covers some important topics that are often sources of confusion, like the distinction between figure-level and axes-level functions, how datasets should be formatted for use in seaborn, and how to customize the appearance of the plots. Other improvements have been made throughout, most notably a thorough re-write of the categorical tutorial categorical\_tutorial. Other small enhancements and bug fixes Changed rugplot to plot a matplotlib LineCollection instead of many Line2D objects, providing a big speedup for large arrays. Changed the default off-diagonal plots to use scatterplot. (Note that the "hue" currently draws three separate scatterplots instead of using the hue semantic of the scatterplot function). Changed color handling when using kdeplot with two variables. The default colormap for the 2D density now follows the color cycle, and the function can use color and label kwargs, adding more flexibility and avoiding a warning when using with multi-plot grids. Added the subplot\_kws parameter to PairGrid for more flexibility. Removed a special case in PairGrid that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal axes. Fixed jointplot/JointGrid and regplot so that they now accept list inputs. Fixed a bug in FacetGrid when using a single row/column level or using col\_wrap=1. Fixed functions that set axis limits so that they preserve auto-scaling state on matplotlib 2.0. Avoided an error when using matplotlib backends that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF). Changed the install infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that pip is aware of. This means that pip install seaborn will now work in an empty environment. Additionally, the dependencies are specified with strict minimal versions. Updated the testing infrastructure to execute tests with pytest (although many individual tests still use nose assertion).},

  abstract = {This is a major release from 0.4. Highlights include new functions for plotting heatmaps, possibly while applying clustering algorithms to discover structured relationships. These functions are complemented by new custom colormap functions and a full set of IPython widgets that allow interactive selection of colormap parameters. The palette tutorial has been rewritten to cover these new tools and more generally provide guidance on how to use color in visualizations. There are also a number of smaller changes and bugfixes. Plotting functions Added the heatmap function for visualizing a matrix of data by color-encoding the values. See the docs for more information. Added the clustermap function for clustering and visualizing a matrix of data, with options to label individual rows and columns by colors. See the docs for more information. This work was lead by Olga Botvinnik. lmplot and pairplot get a new keyword argument, markers. This can be a single kind of marker or a list of different markers for each level of the hue variable. Using different markers for different hues should let plots be more comprehensible when reproduced to black-and-white (i.e. when printed). See the github pull request for examples. More generally, there is a new keyword argument in FacetGrid and PairGrid, hue\_kws. This similarly lets plot aesthetics vary across the levels of the hue variable, but more flexibily. hue\_kws should be a dictionary that maps the name of keyword arguments to lists of values that are as long as the number of levels of the hue variable. The argument subplot\_kws has been added to FacetGrid. This allows for faceted plots with custom projections, including maps with Cartopy. Color palettes Added two new functions to create custom color palettes. For sequential palettes, you can use the light\_palette function, which takes a seed color and creates a ramp from a very light, desaturated variant of it. For diverging palettes, you can use the diverging\_palette function to create a balanced ramp between two endpoints to a light or dark midpoint. See the palette tutorial {$<$}palette\_tutorial{$>$} for more information. Added the ability to specify the seed color for light\_palette and dark\_palette as a tuple of husl or hls space values or as a named xkcd color. The interpretation of the seed color is now provided by the new input parameter to these functions. Added several new interactive palette widgets: choose\_colorbrewer\_palette, choose\_light\_palette, choose\_dark\_palette, and choose\_diverging\_palette. For consistency, renamed the cubehelix widget to choose\_cubehelix\_palette (and fixed a bug where the cubehelix palette was reversed). These functions also now return either a color palette list or a matplotlib colormap when called, and that object will be live-updated as you play with the widget. This should make it easy to iterate over a plot until you find a good representation for the data. See the Github pull request or this notebook (download it to use the widgets) for more information. Overhauled the color palette tutorial to organize the discussion by class of color palette and provide more motivation behind the various choices one might make when choosing colors for their data. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in PairGrid that gave incorrect results (or a crash) when the input DataFrame has a non-default index. Fixed a bug in PairGrid where passing columns with a date-like datatype raised an exception. Fixed a bug where lmplot would show a legend when the hue variable was also used on either the rows or columns (making the legend redundant). Worked around a matplotlib bug that was forcing outliers in boxplot to appear as blue. kdeplot now accepts pandas Series for the data and data2 arguments. Using a non-default correlation method in corrplot now implies sig\_stars=False as the permutation test used to significance values for the correlations uses a pearson metric. Removed pdf.fonttype from the style definitions, as the value used in version 0.4 resulted in very large PDF files.},

  abstract = {In narrow-band systems electrons can interact with each other via a short-range nonretarded attractive potential. The origin of such an effective local attraction can be polaronic or it can be due to a coupling between electrons and excitons or plasmons. It can also result from purely chemical (electronic) mechanisms, especially in compounds with elements favoring disproportionation of valent states. These mechanisms are discussed and an exhaustive list of materials in which such local electron pairing occurs is given. The authors review the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of such systems in several limiting scenarios: (i) Systems with on-site pairing which can be described by the extended negative-U Hubbard model. The strong-attraction limit of this model, at which it reduces to a system of tightly bound electron pairs (bipolarons) on a lattice, is extensively discussed. These electron pairs behaving as hard-core charged bosons can exhibit a superconducting state analogous to that of superfluid 4He II. The change-over from weak-attraction BCS-like superconductivity to the superfluidity of charged hard-core bosons is examined. (ii) Systems with intersite pairing described by an extended Hubbard model with U{$>$}0 and nearest-neighbor attraction and/or nearest-neighbor spin exchange as well as correlated hopping. (iii) A mixture of local pairs and itinerant electrons interacting via a charge-exchange mechanism giving rise to a mutually induced superconductivity in both subsystems. The authors discuss to what extent the picture of local pairing, and in particular superfluidity of hard-core charged bosons on a lattice, can be an explanation for the superconducting and normal-state properties of the high-Tc oxides: doped BaBiO3 and the cuprates.},

Lett. 80 5204), most notably in respect of the  state, which was not observed directly. The energy of 1.53~eV computed for this excitation is in good agreement with the value 1.5~eV deduced from the Raman experiment, and both of these lie well above the energy 0.5~eV suggested previously on the basis of the optical spectrum (Perkins et al 1993 Phys. Rev. Lett. 71 1621). The associated spin-flip energy of approximately 0.2~eV proposed by Kuiper et al is shown to be entirely consistent with the observed N\'eel temperature and with first principles calculations, and further, that it corresponds to the flip of an unpaired dx2-y2 spin in the ground state rather than a dz2 spin in the excited state. The two  excitation energies in the current UHF calculations differ by approximately 0.25~eV from the Raman values, an amount ascribed to the difference in pair correlation energies. In addition, hybrid functional calculations incorporating varying contents of exact exchange are found to offer no systematic improvement. The presence of a nearest neighbour hole in the most stable O(p) configuration is shown to have no significant effect upon either the order or the stability of the  states, with changes in excitation energy of 0.1\textendash 0.2~eV. A comparison with previous cluster calculations indicates that the latter do not capture fully the effect of the surrounding lattice on these highly local excitations. The generality of the direct approach to excitations is further established by calculations of the energies of three nearest neighbour charge-transfer states, which are placed in the range from 5.3 to 5.6~eV, as compared with values around 5~eV predicted previously (Tanaka and Kotani 1993 J. Phys. Soc. Japan 62 464). The  and charge-transfer excitations produce extensive renormalization of the valence levels that lead to substantial reductions in energy from the rigid-band estimates based on the ground state eigenvalue spectrum.},

Our calculations, corrected for both relativistic effects and basis set incompleteness, indicate that most of the methods applied with default settings perform with acceptable accuracy on average. Nevertheless, our calculations also evidenced unexpected and nonsystematic large deviations for specific cases. For group 12 metals (Zn, Cd, Hg), most of the methods provided mean unsigned errors (MUE) less than 5.0 kcal/mol, with DLPNO\textendash CCSD(T) and PBE methods performing excellently (MUE lower 2.0 kcal/mol). Problems started with group 4 metals (Ti and Zr). The best performer for Zr complexes with MUE of 1.8 kcal/mol, PBE0-D3, provides MUE larger than 8 kcal/mol for Ti. DLPNO\textendash CCSD(T) provides a reasonable MUE of 3.3 kcal/mol for Ti reactions but gives MUE a larger than 14.4 kcal/mol for Zr complexes, with all the larger deviations for reactions involving ZrF4. Large and nonsystematic errors have been obtained for group 6 metals (Mo and W), for eight reactions containing Fe, Cu, Nb, and Re complexes. Finally, for the whole set of 111 reactions, the DLPNO\textendash CCSD(T), B3LYP-D3, and PBE0-D3 methods turned out to be the best performers, all providing MUE below 5.0 kcal/mol. Since DFT results cannot be systematically improved and large nonsystematic deviations of 20\textendash 30 kcal/mol were obtained even for best performers, our results indicate that current DFT methods are still unable to provide robust predictions in transition metal thermochemistry, at least for the functionals explored in this work. The same conclusion holds for both DLPNO\textendash CCSD(T) and canonical CCSD(T) methods when used entirely as out-of-the-box. However, if careful investigation of core correlation is performed, relativistic effects are properly included and the quality of the reference wave function is properly checked, CCSD(T) methods can still provide good quality results that might even be used to validate DFT methods due to paucity of accurate thermodynamic data for realistic-sized transition metal complexes.},

Recent experiments on two classes of hole doped cuprates indicate a novel d-wave symmetry for the order. These were motivated by earlier spin fluctuation theoretical studies based on an expansion about hot spots in the Brillouin zone that indicated such an order would be competitive with d-wave superconductivity. Here, we reexamine this problem by solving strong coupling equations in the full Brillouin zone for experimentally relevant parameters. We find that bond-oriented order, as seen experimentally, is strongly suppressed. We also include coupling to B1g phonons and do not see any qualitative change. Our results argue against an itinerant model for the charge order, implying instead that such order is likely due to Coulombic phase separation of the doped holes.},

  abstract = {In a previous work [Phys. Rev. B 77, 085122 (2008)], a procedure for constructing low-energy models of electrons in solids was proposed. The procedure starts with dividing the Hilbert space into two subspaces: the low-energy part (``d space'') and the rest of the space (``r space''). The low-energy model is constructed for the d space by eliminating the degrees of freedom of the r space. The thus derived model contains the strength of electron correlation expressed by a partially screened Coulomb interaction, calculated in the constrained random-phase approximation (cRPA), where screening channels within the d space, Pd, are subtracted. One conceptual problem of this established downfolding method is that for entangled bands it is not clear how to cut out the d space and how to distinguish Pd from the total polarization. Here, we propose a simple procedure to overcome this difficulty. The d space is defined to be an isolated set of bands generated from a set of maximally localized Wannier basis, which consequently defines Pd. The r subspace is constructed as the complementary space orthogonal to the d subspace, resulting in two sets of completely disentangled bands. Using these disentangled bands, the effective parameters of the d space are uniquely determined by the cRPA method. The method is successfully applied to 3d transition metals.},

  abstract = {Titanate compounds have been recognized as key materials for understanding the coupling of magnetism and orbitals in strongly correlated electron systems. In the perovskite Ti oxide RTiO3 (where R represents the trivalent rare-earth ions), which is a typical Mott\textendash Hubbard insulator, the Ti t2g orbitals and spins in the 3d1 state couple each other through the strong electron correlations, resulting in a rich variety of orbital\textendash spin phases. One way of controlling the coupling is to change the tiltings of the TiO6 octahedra (namely the GdFeO3-type distortion) by varying the R ions, through which the relative ratio of the electron bandwidth to the Coulomb interaction is controlled. With this control, these Mott insulators exhibit an antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic (AFM\textendash FM) phase transition, which has turned out to be a consequence of rich orbital physics in these materials. The origin and nature of orbital\textendash spin structures of these Mott insulators have been intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. When the Mott insulators are doped with carriers, the titanates show touchstone properties of the filling controlled Mott transition. In this paper, we first review the state of the art on the studies for understanding physics contained in the properties of the perovskite titanates. On the properties of the insulators, we focus on the following three topics: (1) the origin and nature of the ferromagnetism as well as the orbital ordering in the compounds with relatively small R ions such as GdTiO3 and YTiO3, (2) the origin of the G-type antiferromagnetism and the orbital state in LaTiO3 and (3) the orbital\textendash spin structures in other AFM(G) compounds with relatively large R ions (R = Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm). On the basis of these discussions, we discuss the whole phase diagram together with mechanisms of the magnetic phase transition. On the basis of the microscopic understanding of the orbital\textendash spin states, we show that the Ti t2g degeneracy is inherently lifted in the titanates, which allows the single-band descriptions of the ground-state and the low-energy electronic structures as a good starting point. Our analyses indicate that these compounds offer good touchstone materials described by the single-band Hubbard model on the cubic lattice. From this insight, we also re-analyse the hole-doped titanates TiO3 (where A represents the divalent alkaline-earth ions). Experimentally revealed filling- and bandwidth-dependent properties and the critical behaviour of the metal\textendash insulator transitions are discussed in the light of theories based on the single-band Hubbard models.},

  abstract = {Magnetoelectric phase diagrams of the rare-earth (R) Mn perovskites RMnO3 are theoretically studied by focusing on crucial roles of the symmetric magnetostriction or the Peierls-type spin-phonon coupling through extending our previous work [ M. Mochizuki et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 105 037205 (2010)]. We first construct a microscopic classical Heisenberg model for RMnO3 including the frustrated spin exchanges, single-ion anisotropy, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also incorporate the lattice degree of freedom coupled to the Mn spins via the Peierls-type magnetostriction. By analyzing this model using the replica-exchange Monte Carlo technique, we reproduce the entire phase diagram of RMnO3 in the plane of temperature and magnitude of the orthorhombic lattice distortion. Surprisingly it is found that in the ab-plane spiral spin phase, the (S{$\cdot$}S)-type magnetostriction plays an important role for the ferroelectric order with polarization P{$\parallel$}a whose contribution is comparable to or larger than the contribution from the (S\texttimes S)-type magnetostriction, whereas in the bc-plane spiral phase, the ferroelectric order with P{$\parallel$}c is purely of (S\texttimes S) origin. This explains much larger P in the ab-plane spiral phase than the bc-plane spiral phase as observed experimentally and gives a clue how to enhance the magnetoelectric coupling in the spin-spiral-based multiferroics. We also predict a noncollinear deformation of the E-type spin structure resulting in the finite (S\texttimes S) contribution to the ferroelectric order with P{$\parallel$}a, and a wide coexisting regime of the commensurate E and incommensurate spiral states, which resolve several experimental puzzles.},

The low-energy behavior of two of the models remains equivalent at finite temperature, however that of the third does not because its low-energy behavior is controlled by rare events due to thermal fluctuations, which transfer spectral weight well below the T=0 quasiparticle peaks and generate a pseudogaplike phenomenology. Our results demonstrate that having T=0 spectra with similar quasiparticles is not a sufficient condition to ensure that two models are equivalent, i.e., that their low-energy properties are similar. We also argue that the pseudogaplike phenomenology is quite generic for models of t-J type, appearing in any dimension and for carriers injected into both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic backgrounds.},

We provide proof that the number of continuous variables cannot be smaller than 2N-2, N being the Hilbert-space dimension.

We argue for a competition of the ZR state with nearby states formed by a ``doped'' hole occupying purely oxygen nonbonding a2g({$\pi$}) and eu({$\pi$}) orbitals rather than a conventional b1g(dx2-y2) Cu 3d-O 2p hybrid. The temperature variation of the 6,7Li NMR line shape and spin-lattice relaxation rate point to a gradual slowing down of some magnetic order parameter's fluctuations without distinct signatures of a phase transition down to T=2 K.

It is obtained as the exact ground state of the Kitaev spin model with bond-dependent anisotropic interactions. The peculiar interactions can be yielded by the synergy of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlations for specific electron configuration and lattice geometry, which is known as the Jackeli\textendash Khaliullin mechanism. Based on this mechanism, there has been a fierce race for the materialization of the Kitaev spin liquid over the last decade, but the candidates have been still limited mostly to 4d- and 5d-electron compounds including cations with the low-spin d5 electron configuration, such as Ir4+ and Ru3+. Here we discuss recent efforts to extend the material perspective beyond the Jackeli\textendash Khaliullin mechanism, by carefully reexamining the two requisites, formation of the jeff = 1/2 doublet and quantum interference between the exchange processes, for not only dbut also f-electron systems. We present three examples: the systems including Co2+ and Ni3+ with the high-spin d7 electron configuration, Pr4+ with the f1-electron configuration, and polar asymmetry in the lattice structure. In particular, the latter two are intriguing since they may realize the antiferromagnetic Kitaev interactions, in contrast to the ferromagnetic ones in the existing candidates. This partial overview would stimulate further material exploration of the Kitaev spin liquids and its topological properties due to fractional excitations.},

  abstract = {An outline is given of the model for some high-temperature superconductors which assumes that the carriers are holes in the (hybridized) oxygen 2p band and form `spin polarons' with the moments on the copper atoms. A comparison is made with observations of spin polarons in Gd3-x v x S4 and with the properties of La1-x Sr x VO3 in relation to those of La2-x Sr x CuO4. It is assumed, following several authors, that in the superconductors the polarons form bipolarons, which are bosons, and a comparison is made with some other treatments of this hypothesis. It is proposed that in many such superconductors the boson, essentially a pair of these holes, moves in an impurity band, and that normally all the polarons (fermions) form bipolarons; the fermions repel each other on the same site (positive Hubbard U) but attract when on adjacent sites; the critical temperature T c is then that at which the Bose gas becomes non-degenerate. In such materials a non-degenerate gas of bosons would carry the current above T c as first suggested by Alexandrov et al. (1986). The linear increase in the resistivity above T c is explained on this hypothesis. The effective mass of the bipolaron is, we believe, large ({$\sim$}20\textendash 30m e). The copper 3d9 moments in the superconducting range resonate between their two orientations as a consequence of the motion of the carriers, as they do in the description by Brinkman and Rice (1970) of highly correlated metals. Spin polarons, we believe, form only when this is so, but not in the antiferromagnetic range of x. A discussion is given of the resistivity above T c, thermopower above T c, and of the nature of the superconducting gap as shown by tunnelling. We confine our discussion to the materials containing copper, excluding for instance cubic Ba1-x K x BiO3, and possibly any superconductor containing bismuth, where the bosons may be Bi3+.},

In the former, band inversion is susceptible to changes of the chemical environment, e.g. by defects, while the latter are less affected by defects due to the larger energy scale associated with atomic relativistic effects. Motivated by recent experiments, we study the effect of Te-vacancies and Te-adatoms on the electronic properties of WTe\$\_2\$. We find that the Te-vacancies have a formation energy of \$2.21\$ eV, while the formation energy of the Te-adatoms is much lower with \$0.72\$ eV. The vacancies strongly influence the band structure and we present evidence that band inversion is already reversed at the nominal composition of WTe\$\_\{1.97\}\$. In contrast, we show that the adatoms do not change the electronic structure in the vicinity of the Fermi level and thus the topological properties. Our findings indicate that Te-adatoms should be present in thin films that are grown in a Te-rich environment, and we suggest that they have been observed in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.},

Similarly, detailed first principles calculations directly compute the spin density in materials. In this work, the authors carefully compare experimentally measured magnetic neutron intensities to three levels of theory: density functional theory in two approximations, and fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo. While each theory performs similarly for the simple antiferromagnet MnO, there are significant differences between density functional theory and diffusion Monte Carlo in NiO. For both materials, fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo shows the lowest RMS error with respect to experiment for the form factor and the intensity. Through connection of the intensities and form factors to the real-space spin densities, it is shown that diffusion Monte Carlo spin density becomes more diffuse by spreading spin away from the bond directions. This benchmark is of importance when considering the efficacy of an ab initio calculation in capturing both the long-range magnetic correlations and the microscopic spin details of magnetic systems.},

One possible GMR mechanism consists in a change of such a state under the magnetic field. If the magnetic moment of these materials is saturated, they display a resistivity peak in the vicinity of the Curie point. It is caused by the interaction of the charge carriers with spatial fluctuations of the electric potential and local magnetization. Suppression of this peak by the magnetic field leads to a GMR in ferromagnetic conductors.},

  abstract = {We report superconductivity and magnetism in a new family of topological semimetals, the ternary half-Heusler compound RPdBi (R: rare earth). In this series, tuning of the rare earth f-electron component allows for simultaneous control of both lattice density via lanthanide contraction and the strength of magnetic interaction via de Gennes scaling, allowing for a unique tuning of the normal-state band inversion strength, superconducting pairing, and magnetically ordered ground states. Antiferromagnetism with ordering vector ({$\frac{1}{2}$},{$\frac{1}{2}$},{$\frac{1}{2}$}) occurs below a N\'eel temperature that scales with de Gennes factor dG, whereas a superconducting transition is simultaneously supressed with increasing dG. With superconductivity appearing in a system with noncentrosymmetric crystallographic symmetry, the possibility of spin-triplet Cooper pairing with nontrivial topology analogous to that predicted for the normal-state electronic structure provides a unique and rich opportunity to realize both predicted and new exotic excitations in topological materials. Tunable superconductivity and magnetism in noncentrosymmetric RPdBi provide a new route to exotic topological excitations.

To establish macroscopic and microscopic evaluations of phonon properties, specific heat and inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) were performed in the stoichiometric SrCuO2. Fundamental phonon parameters (the Debye temperature and the average sound velocity) were estimated from the derived phonon density of states (ph-DOS) from the IXS measurement. The Debye temperature independently determined from the specific heat measurement was in good agreement with that from the IXS result. By applying the established method to superconducting compositions, it becomes possible to study phonon behaviors in detail with respect to high- T c superconductivity and/or strong electron correlations.},

Recently, the transition metal chalcogenides including selenium and sulfur have been of interest because of their correlated-electron properties, as seen in the iron-based superconductors and the transition metal dichalcogenides. However, the chalcogenide chemical space is less explored than that of oxides, and there is an open question of whether there may be new materials heretofore undiscovered. We perform a systematic combined theoretical and experimental search over ternary phase diagrams that are empty in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database containing cations, transition metals, and one of selenium or sulfur. In these 27 ternary systems, we use a probabilistic model to reduce the likelihood of false negative predictions, which results in a list of 24 candidate materials. We then conduct a variety of synthesis experiments to check the candidate materials for stability. While the prediction method did obtain previously unknown compositions that are predicted stable within density functional theory, none of the candidate materials formed in our experiments. We come to the conclusion that these phase diagrams are ``empty'' in the case of bulk synthesis, but it remains a possibility that alternate synthesis routes may produce some of these phases.},

Using group theory arguments and first-principles calculations, we show that the electronic properties of the phases involved in these transitions are controlled by symmetry principles. The valence bands in these systems are described by simple and composite band representations constructed from localized Wannier functions centered on points unoccupied by atoms, and which are not necessarily all symmetrical. The character of the Wannier functions is closely related to the degree of s-p(-d) hybridization and reflects multicenter chemical bonding in these insulating states. The conditions under which an insulating state is allowed for structures having an integer number of atoms per primitive unit cell as well as reentrant (i.e., metal-insulator-metal) transition sequences are detailed, resulting in predictions of behavior such as phases having band-contact lines. The general principles developed are tested and applied to the alkali and alkaline earth metals, including elements where high-pressure insulating phases have been reported (e.g., Li, Na, and Ca).},

The exact solution to the two-particle problem leads to a bound state in the dx2-y2 subspace. Numerical techniques show that the model has strong dx2-y2 pairing correlations in the ground state at low fermionic density. Within a self-consistent random phase approximation diagrammatic study, the model has a d-wave superconducting (SC) phase. The density dependence of the critical temperature is calculated. We argue that in the context of d-wave SC this model fulfills the role that the attractive on-site Hubbard model has played for s-wave SC. We also show that another candidate, the attractive t-U-V model, is actually not useful as a toy model for d-wave SC for a variety of reasons.},

These methods are capable of achieving very high accuracy, yet the scaling with system size is sufficiently favorable to allow applications to condensed-matter systems. Defects in semiconductors pose a variety of challenges to computational electronic-structure methods. As well as the large system sizes required, one is faced with calculating energy differences between rather disparate interatomic bonding configurations, and calculating excited state energies, sometimes including the energies of multiplets. Applications of VMC and DMC to defects in semiconductors are still in their infancy but, as I will describe, these methods possess features that make them well suited for addressing some important issues in the field. In this chapter I first discuss why we expect VMC and DMC calculations to be valuable in studying defects in semiconductors. I then review the techniques themselves, concentrating on the issues most pertinent to calculations for defects in solids. I describe recent applications to self-interstitial defects in crystalline silicon, the low-energy electronic states of the neutral vacancy in diamond, and the Schottky defect energy in magnesium oxide. The chapter ends with a perspective on the future of such studies.},

Materials with the canonical ThCr2Si2-type structure have proved particularly fruitful in this regard, as they exhibit a wide range of technologically advantageous physical properties described by ``many-body physics,'' including high-temperature superconductivity and heavy fermion behavior. Here, using high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction and time-of-flight neutron scattering, we show that the isostructural mixed valence compound KNi2S2 displays a number of highly unusual structural transitions, most notably the presence of charge density wave fluctuations that disappear on cooling. This behavior occurs without magnetic or charge order, in contrast to expectations based on other known materials exhibiting related phenomena. Furthermore, the low-temperature electronic state of KNi2S2 is found to exhibit many characteristics of heavy-fermion behavior, including a heavy electron state (m{${_\ast}$}/me{$\sim$} 24), with a negative coefficient of thermal expansion, and superconductivity below Tc=0.46(2) K. In the potassium nickel sulfide, these behaviors arise in the absence of localized magnetism, and instead appear to originate in proximity to charge order.},

This heavy state evolves into superconductivity at Tc = 0.80(1) K. These properties resemble that of a many-body heavy-fermion state, which derives from the hybridization between localized magnetic states and conduction electrons. Yet, no evidence for localized magnetism or magnetic order is found in KNi2Se2 from magnetization measurements or neutron diffraction. Instead, neutron pair-distribution-function analysis reveals the presence of local charge-density-wave distortions that disappear on cooling, an effect opposite to what is typically observed, suggesting that the low-temperature electronic state of KNi2Se2 arises from cooperative Coulomb interactions and proximity to, but avoidance of, charge order.},

Using LDA+DMFT and LDA'+DMFT calculations we show, that electronic correlations in K\_\{1-x\}Fe\_\{2-y\}Se\_2 influence the electronic structure much more significantly, than in the most studied 122 system. We also discuss the electronic structure of several multiple-band superconductors, chemically similar to iron-based HTSC, with relatively small values of \$T\_c\$, such as SrPt\_\{2\}As\_\{2\}, APt\_\{3\}P, (Sr,Ca)Pd\_2As\_2, and non superconducting compound BaFe\_2Se\_3. It is shown, that electronic structure of these systems is very different from previously studies iron pnictides and chalcogenides. The value of T\_c in these systems can be understood within the simple BCS model.},

  abstract = {Besides superconductivity, copper-oxide high-temperature superconductors are susceptible to other types of ordering. We used scanning tunneling microscopy and resonant elastic x-ray scattering measurements to establish the formation of charge ordering in the high-temperature superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. Depending on the hole concentration, the charge ordering in this system occurs with the same period as those found in Y-based or La-based cuprates and displays the analogous competition with superconductivity. These results indicate the similarity of charge organization competing with superconductivity across different families of cuprates. We observed this charge ordering to leave a distinct electron-hole asymmetric signature (and a broad resonance centered at +20 milli\textendash electron volts) in spectroscopic measurements, indicating that it is likely related to the organization of holes in a doped Mott insulator. Copper-Oxide Superconductors Copper-oxide superconductors have a complex electronic structure. A charge density order has been observed in two cuprate families; however, it has been unclear whether such an order exists in Bi-based compounds (see the Perspective by Morr). Comin et al. (p. 390, published online 19 December) and da Silva Neto et al. (p. 393, published online 19 December) address this question in single-layer and double-layer Bibased cuprates, respectively. For both families of materials, surface measurements by scanning tunneling spectroscopy agree with bulk measurements obtained through resonant elastic x-ray scattering, which suggests the formation of short-range correlations that modulate the charge density of the carriers over a range of dopings. Thus, charge ordering may represent a common characteristic of the major cuprate families.},

However, several generic characteristics of the copper oxide superconductors have emerged as the essential ingredients of and/or constraints on any viable microscopic model of HTS. Besides a critical temperature Tc of the order of 100 K, they include a d-wave superconducting gap with Fermi liquid nodal excitations, a pseudogap with d-symmetry and the characteristic temperature scale T*, an anomalous doping-dependent oxygen isotope shift, nanometre-scale gap inhomogeneity and so on. The isotope shift implies a key role for oxygen vibrations, but conventional Bardeen\textendash Cooper\textendash Schrieffer single-phonon coupling is essentially forbidden by symmetry and by the on-site Coulomb interaction U. Here we invoke the nonlinear modulation of the Cu\textendash Cu bond by planar oxygen vibrations. The Fermi liquid nature of the d-wave superconducting ground state supports a weak-coupling treatment of this modulation. The dominant fluctuations are manifested in a pattern of oxygen vibrational square amplitudes with quadrupolar symmetry around a given Cu site. On the basis of such bond fluctuations, both dynamic and static, we can understand the salient features of HTS.},

However, the thermodynamics and kinetics of its hydrogen release and uptake need to be improved before it can meet the requirements for mobile applications. In this study, we investigate the confinement of LiBH4 in ordered mesoporous SiO2 and its effect on the hydrogen sorption properties. We demonstrate that, only under hydrogen pressure, melt infiltration is an effective method for the synthesis of LiBH4/SBA-15 nanocomposites. Our work clearly shows that formation of lithium silicates from LiBH4 and SiO2 can effectively be suppressed by hydrogen. Thus, under hydrogen pressure, LiBH4 can fully fill the mesopores of SBA-15 while the long-range order of the mesopores is maintained. The confined LiBH4 has enhanced hydrogen desorption properties, with desorption starting at 150 \textdegree C. However, upon dehydrogenation, SiO2 and decomposition products of LiBH4 react to form Li2SiO3 and Li4SiO4, leading to irreversible hydrogen loss.},

  abstract = {A new approach to linear scaling construction of the density matrix is proposed, based on trace resetting purification of an effective Hamiltonian. Trace resetting is related to the trace preserving canonical purification scheme of Palser and Manolopoulos [Phys. Rev. B 58, 12704 (1999)] in that they both work with a predefined occupation number and do not require adjustment or prior knowledge of the chemical potential. In the trace resetting approach, trace conservation is not strictly enforced, allowing greater flexibility in the choice of purification polynomial and improved performance for Hamiltonian systems with high or low filling. However, optimal polynomials may in some cases admit unstable solutions, requiring a resetting mechanism to bring the solution back into the domain of convergent purification. A quartic trace resetting method is developed, along with analysis of stability and error accumulation due to incomplete sparse-matrix methods that employ a threshold {$\tau$} to achieve sparsity. It is argued that threshold metered purification errors in the density matrix are O ({$\tau\Delta$}g -1 ) at worst, where {$\Delta$}g is the gap at the chemical potential. In the low filling regime, purification derived total energies are shown to converge smoothly with {$\tau$} 2 for RPBE/STO-6G C60 and a RPBE0/STO-3G Ti substituted zeolite. For the zeolite, the quartic trace resetting method is found to be both faster and over an order of magnitude more accurate than the Palser\textendash Manolopoulos method. In the low filling limit, true linear scaling is demonstrated for RHF/6-31G** water clusters, and the trace resetting method is found to be both faster and an order of magnitude more accurate than the Palser\textendash Manolopoulos scheme. Basis set progression of RPBE chlorophyll reveals the quartic trace resetting to be up to four orders of magnitude more accurate than the Palser\textendash Manolopoulos algorithm in the limit of low filling. Furthermore, the ability of trace resetting and trace preserving algorithms to deal with degeneracy and fractional occupation is discussed.},

  abstract = {While most efforts to improve students' learning in computer science education have focused on designing new pedagogies or tools, comparatively little research has focused on redesigning examinations to improve students' learning. Cognitive science research, however, has robustly demonstrated that getting students to practice using their knowledge in testing environments can significantly improve learning through a phenomenon known as the testing effect. The testing effect has been shown to improve learning more than rehearsal strategies such as re-reading a textbook or re-watching lectures. In this paper, we present a quasi-experimental study to examine the effect of using frequent, automated examinations in an advanced computer science course, "Programming Languages and Compilers" (CS 421). In Fall 2014, students were given traditional paper-based exams, but in Fall 2015 a computer-based testing facility enabled the course to offer more frequent examinations while other aspects of the course were held constant. A comparison of 292 student scores across the two semesters revealed a significant change in the distribution of students' grades with fewer students failing the final examination, and proportionately more students now earning grades of B and C instead. This data suggests that focusing on redesigning the nature of examinations may indeed be a relatively untapped opportunity to improve students' learning.},

Typically, these occur in lattices that act to frustrate the appearance of magnetism. In two dimensions, the classic example is the kagome lattice composed of corner sharing triangles. There are a variety of minerals whose transition metal ions form such a lattice. Hence, a number of them have been studied and were then subsequently synthesized in order to obtain more pristine samples. Of particular note was the report in 2005 by Dan Nocera's group of the synthesis of herbertsmithite, composed of a lattice of copper ions sitting on a kagome lattice, which indeed does not order down to the lowest measured temperature despite the existence of a large exchange interaction of 17 meV. Over the past decade, this material has been extensively studied, yielding a number of intriguing surprises that have in turn motivated a resurgence of interest in the theoretical study of the spin 1/2 Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice. This Colloquium reviews these developments and then discusses potential future directions, both experimental and theoretical, as well as the challenge of doping these materials with the hope that this could lead to the discovery of novel topological and superconducting phases.},

Determining correlation strengths requires both precise definitions and a careful comparison between experiment and theory. In this paper, we define the correlation strength via the magnitude of the electron self-energy near the Fermi level. For the case of LaNiO3, we obtain both the experimental and theoretical mass enhancements m\ding{73}/m by considering high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and density functional + dynamical mean field theory (DFT + DMFT) calculations. We use valence-band photoemission data to constrain the free parameters in the theory and demonstrate a quantitative agreement between the experiment and theory when both the realistic crystal structure and strong electronic correlations are taken into account. In addition, by considering DFT + DMFT calculations on epitaxially strained LaNiO3, we find a strain-induced evolution of m\ding{73}/m in qualitative agreement with trends derived from optics experiments. These results provide a benchmark for the accuracy of the DFT + DMFT theoretical approach, and can serve as a test case when considering other complex materials. By establishing the level of accuracy of the theory, this work also will enable better quantitative predictions when engineering new emergent properties in nickelate heterostructures.},

Simple physical arguments are given which show that the high-density calculation of Gell-Mann and Brueckner is valid for rs{$\lessequivlnt$}1 while the low-density calculation of Wigner is valid for rs{$\greaterequivlnt$}20. For actual metallic densities it is shown that the contribution to the correlation energy from long-wavelength momentum transfers (k{$<\beta$}k0{$<$}0.47rs12k0) may be accurately calculated in the random phase approximation. This contribution is calculated using the Bohm-Pines extended Hamiltonian, and is shown to be E({$\beta$})=(-0.458{$\beta$}2rs+0.866{$\beta$}3rs32-0.98{$\beta$}4rs2)(+0.019{$\beta$}4rs+0.706{$\beta$}5rs52+{$\cdots$})ry. An identical result is obtained by a suitable expansion of the result of Gell-Mann and Brueckner; the validity of the Bohm-Pines neglect of subsidiary conditions in the calculation of the ground-state energy is thereby explicitly established. The contribution to the correlation energy from sufficiently high momentum transfers (k{$\greaterequivlnt$}k0) will arise only from the interaction between electrons of antiparallel spin, and may be estimated using second-order perturbation theory. The contribution arising from intermediate momentum transfers (0.47rs12k0{$\lessequivlnt$}k{$\lessequivlnt$}k0) cannot be calculated analytically; the interpolation procedures for this domain proposed by Pines and Hubbard are shown to be nearly identical, and their accuracy is estimated as {$\sim$}15\%.

  abstract = {Once the crystal structure of a chemical substance is known, many properties can be predicted reliably and routinely. Therefore if researchers could predict the crystal structure of a material before it is synthesized, they could significantly accelerate the discovery of new materials. In addition, the ability to predict crystal structures at arbitrary conditions of pressure and temperature is invaluable for the study of matter at extreme conditions, where experiments are difficult.Crystal structure prediction (CSP), the problem of finding the most stable arrangement of atoms given only the chemical composition, has long remained a major unsolved scientific problem. Two problems are entangled here: search, the efficient exploration of the multidimensional energy landscape, and ranking, the correct calculation of relative energies. For organic crystals, which contain a few molecules in the unit cell, search can be quite simple as long as a researcher does not need to include many possible isomers or conformations of the molecules; therefore ranking becomes the main challenge. For inorganic crystals, quantum mechanical methods often provide correct relative energies, making search the most critical problem. Recent developments provide useful practical methods for solving the search problem to a considerable extent. One can use simulated annealing, metadynamics, random sampling, basin hopping, minima hopping, and data mining. Genetic algorithms have been applied to crystals since 1995, but with limited success, which necessitated the development of a very different evolutionary algorithm. This Account reviews CSP using one of the major techniques, the hybrid evolutionary algorithm USPEX (Universal Structure Predictor: Evolutionary Xtallography).Using recent developments in the theory of energy landscapes, we unravel the reasons evolutionary techniques work for CSP and point out their limitations. We demonstrate that the energy landscapes of chemical systems have an overall shape and explore their intrinsic dimensionalities. Because of the inverse relationships between order and energy and between the dimensionality and diversity of an ensemble of crystal structures, the chances that a random search will find the ground state decrease exponentially with increasing system size. A well-designed evolutionary algorithm allows for much greater computational efficiency.We illustrate the power of evolutionary CSP through applications that examine matter at high pressure, where new, unexpected phenomena take place. Evolutionary CSP has allowed researchers to make unexpected discoveries such as a transparent phase of sodium, a partially ionic form of boron, complex superconducting forms of calcium, a novel superhard allotrope of carbon, polymeric modifications of nitrogen, and a new class of compounds, perhydrides. These methods have also led to the discovery of novel hydride superconductors including the ?impossible? LiHn (n = 2, 6, 8) compounds, and CaLi2. We discuss extensions of the method to molecular crystals, systems of variable composition, and the targeted optimization of specific physical properties.},

  abstract = {The impurity induced in-gap bound state in multi-orbital superconductors is discussed based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation and T-matrix approximation. It is shown that multiple bound states appear depending on the strength of the impurity potential in the case of unconventional s-wave (or s+--wave) superconductivity. This result can be used to distinguish between the conventional s-wave and unconventional s-wave states. T-matrix approximation using a simplified model supports the numerical results obtained in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. It is shown that the T-matrix can be block diagonalized when we use orbital representation. As a result, each orbital can make the impurity bound state independently, leading to the multiple structure of the bound states. From the analysis of the T-matrix approximation, we understand the reasons why the bound states always appear pair-wise at the positions of {$\pm\omega$} and why there is a large asymmetry of the two peaks. We also show that the particle-hole asymmetry of the density of states gives rise to the asymmetry with respect to the strength of the impurity potential. The connection between the obtained results and the iron-pnictide superconductors is also provided.},

There are wide variations in the degree of charge disproportionation, length scale, and orientation in the mixed-valence compounds: these have been the subject of intense theoretical study, but little is known about the microscopic electronic structure. Here we have fabricated an idealized structure to examine these issues by growing atomically abrupt layers of LaTi3+O3 embedded in SrTi4+O3. Using an atomic-scale electron beam, we have observed the spatial distribution of the extra electron on the titanium sites. This distribution results in metallic conductivity, even though the superlattice structure is based on two insulators. Despite the chemical abruptness of the interfaces, we find that a minimum thickness of five LaTiO3 layers is required for the centre titanium site to recover bulk-like electronic properties. This represents a framework within which the short-length-scale electronic response can be probed and incorporated in thin-film oxide heterostructures.},

In the absence of forces other than the Coulomb attraction, the probability of escape equals the reciprocal of the Boltzmann factor. This result includes the correlation between temperature and pressure coefficients of the ionization by light particles previously predicted by Compton, Bennett and Stearns, if one allows their basic hypothesis about the laws which govern the initial separation of the ions. The effect of an electric field is to increase the fraction of escaping ions by a factor which in the incipient stage of the effect is proportional to the field intensity and independent of the initial distance, although it depends on the orientation of an ion pair. The predicted increase of the ionization current is a little more than one percent for every 100 volts/cm, which accounts for the observed effects of fields exceeding 1500 volts/cm. A reasonable amount of columnar recombination would help to explain the proportionately greater effects of weak fields. The inferred initial separations of the ions are apparently compatible with present knowledge of electron scattering and attachment.},

In particular, the question of whether the absolute macroscopic polarization or the difference between the polarizations of two states of an insulating crystal is a well-defined bulk property has remained a controversial one. Recently, King-Smith and Vanderbilt, and Resta have provided an approach in terms of the geometric Berrys phase of electronic orbitals in an independent-particle approximation. Here we extend the derivation of Niu and Thouless for quantized charge transport to the case where the quantum adiabatic evolution is noncyclic, and we show how this polarization difference can be written in terms of a Berrys phase for a system with many-body interactions. We also discuss the origin and magnitude of the ``quantum uncertainty'' that appears when a path-independent gauge is used to compute those geometric quantum phases. This geometric viewpoint not only helps us understand the issues raised above but provides a mathematical method to compute polarizations in a many-body framework.},

This projection increases the transition pressure pt from DFT predictions, being of the same tendency as that for Si bulk crystal. The choice of the exchange-correlation functional in DFT was found to significantly determine the phase-transition pressure, while DMC gave more accurate results for this transition pressure.},

The absence of these singularities is a desired feature for quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations, because it considerably reduces local energy fluctuations when sampling the QMC wave function. A modified procedure for obtaining soft pseudopotentials is introduced. Stability of QMC calculations with the developed pseudopotentials is demonstrated by the ability to use larger time steps for comparable accuracy with the previously available pseudopotentials. As expected, ionization potentials and electron affinities computed using the present approach compare very favorably with other Hartree\textendash Fock pseudopotential methods. \textcopyright{} 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

Metal borohydrides [LiBH4, Mg(BH4)2, Ca(BH4)2] are attractive candidates for onboard storage because they contain high densities of hydrogen by weight and by volume. Using a set of recently developed theoretical first-principles methods, we predict currently unknown crystal structures and hydrogen storage reactions in the Li-Mg-Ca-B-H system. Hydrogen release from LiBH4 and Mg(BH4)2 is predicted to proceed via intermediate Li2B12H12 and MgB12H12 phases, while for Ca borohydride two competing reaction pathways (into CaB6 and CaH2, and into CaB12H12 and CaH2) are found to have nearly equal free energies. We predict two new hydrogen storage reactions that are some of the most attractive among the presently known ones. They combine high gravimetric densities (8.4 and 7.7 wt \% H2) with low enthalpies [approximately 25 kJ/(mol H2)] and are thermodynamically reversible at low pressures due to low vibrational entropies of the product phases containing the [B12H12]2- anion.},

In the second part, we discuss in detail the effects of doping elements and concentrations, oxygen partial pressure, substrate and its orientation and temperature, deposition rate, post-annealing temperature and co-doping on the local structure and subsequent ferromagnetic ordering of TM-doped ZnO. It is unambiguously demonstrated that room-temperature ferromagnetism is strongly correlated with structural defects, and the carriers involved in carrier-mediated exchange are by-products of defects created in ZnO. The third part focuses on recent progress in TM-doped ZnO-based spintronics, such as magnetic tunnel junctions and spin field-effect transistors, which provide a route for spin injection from TM-doped ZnO to ZnO. Thus, TM-doped ZnO materials are useful spin sources for spintronics.},

  abstract = {The thermodynamic properties of magnesium hydride nanoparticles have been investigated by hydrogen decomposition pressure measurements using the Sieverts technique. A mechanochemical method was used to synthesize MgH2 nanoparticles (down to {$\sim$}7 nm in size) embedded in a LiCl salt matrix. In comparison to bulk MgH2, the mechanochemically produced MgH2 with the smallest particle size showed a small but measurable decrease in the decomposition reaction enthalpy ({$\Delta$}H decrease of 2.84 kJ/mol H2 from {$\Delta$}Hbulk = 74.06 {$\pm$} 0.42 kJ/mol H2 to {$\Delta$}Hnano = 71.22 {$\pm$} 0.49 kJ/mol H2). The reduction in {$\Delta$}H matches theoretical predictions and was also coupled with a similar reduction in reaction entropy ({$\Delta$}S decrease of 3.8 J/mol H2/K from {$\Delta$}Sbulk = 133.4 {$\pm$} 0.7 J/mol H2/K to {$\Delta$}Snano = 129.6 {$\pm$} 0.8 J/mol H2/K). The thermodynamic changes in the MgH2 nanoparticle system correspond to a drop in the 1 bar hydrogen equilibrium temperature (T1\,bar) by {$\sim$}6 \textdegree C to 276.2 {$\pm$} 2.4 \textdegree C in contrast to the bulk MgH2 system at 281.8 {$\pm$} 2.2 \textdegree C. The reduction in the desorption temperature is less than that expected from theoretical studies due to the decrease in {$\Delta$}S that acts to partially counteract the effect from the change in {$\Delta$}H.},

Holes at the lower concentration form small polarons, in which the hole is mainly localized on four oxygen ions surrounding one copper ion. The polaron is a spin one-half ferromagnetic polaron (Cu5O4), in which the moment on the central copper ion is parallel to those on the four neighboring copper ions and the moment on the oxygen ions is opposed to that on the copper ions. This is therefore an Emery\textendash Reiter spin polaron rather than a Zhang\textendash Rice singlet. At the higher hole concentration (x=0.125), many cuprates form stripes. Hybrid density functional theory calculations on linear chains of spin polarons separated by 4a0 show a group of bands localized mainly on the stripe. Spins on neighboring copper ions in the stripe are parallel and so the stripe forms a magnetic antiphase boundary between antiferromagnetically ordered blocks of copper spins. Stripes of this kind, which run in one direction only, may explain recent scanning tunneling microscopy data from Ca2-xNaxCuO2Cl2 by Kohsaka et al. Science 315 1380 (2007) We also consider an ordered spin polaron phase where magnetic antiphase boundaries intersect at right angles. In this case, sets of four copper ions in squares at stripe intersections have parallel spins. This phase may be the 4\texttimes 4 checkerboard pattern reported by Hanaguri et al.

Two solutions can be stabilized in the Kondo phase: namely, a uniform hybridization when the band masses of the conduction electrons and the spinons have the same sign, and a modulated one when they have opposite sign. For the uniform case, we show that above a very small temperature scale, the critical fluctuations associated with the vanishing hybridization have dynamical exponent z=3, giving rise to a resistivity that has a TlogT behavior. We also find that the specific heat coefficient diverges logarithmically in temperature, as observed in a number of heavy fermion metals.},

  abstract = {In the series of 3d(t2g)1 perovskites, SrVO3\textendash CaVO3\textendash LaTiO3\textendash YTiO3, the transition-metal d electron becomes increasingly localized and undergoes a Mott transition between CaVO3 and LaTiO3. By defining a low-energy Hubbard Hamiltonian in the basis of Wannier functions for the t2g LDA band and solving it in the single-site dynamical mean-field (DMFT) approximation, it was recently shown (Pavarini et al (2004) Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 176403) that simultaneously with the Mott transition there occurs a strong suppression of orbital fluctuations due to splitting of the t2g levels. The present paper reviews and expands this work, in particular in the direction of exposing the underlying chemical mechanisms by means of ab initio LDA Wannier functions generated with the Nth order muffin-tin orbital (NMTO) method. The Wannier functions for the occupied oxygen-p band illustrate the importance of oxygen-p to large cation-d covalency for the progressive GdFeO3-type distortion along the series. The oxygen-p orbitals which pd{$\sigma$}-bond to the cations are the same as those which pd{$\pi$}-bond to the transition-metal t2g orbitals. As a consequence, the Wannier functions for the t2g band exhibit residual covalency between the transition-metal t2g, the large cation-d, and the oxygen-p states. This residual covalency, which increases along the series, turns out to be responsible not only for the splittings, {$\Delta$}, of the t2g levels, but also for non-cubic perturbations of the hopping integrals, both of which are decisive for the Mott transition. We find good agreement with the optical and photoemission spectra for all four materials, with the crystal-field splittings and orbital polarizations recently measured for the titanates, and with the metallization volume (pressure) for LaTiO3. The metallization volume for YTiO3 is predicted and the role of the Jahn\textendash Teller (JT) distortion is discussed. For use in future many-body calculations, we tabulate the t2g on-site and hopping matrix elements for all four materials and give an analytical expression for the orthorhombic Hamiltonian in the k + Q representation. Using conventional super-exchange theory, our on-site and hopping matrix elements reproduce the observed magnetic orders in LaTiO3 and YTiO3, but the results are sensitive to detail, in particular for YTiO3 where, without the JT distortion, the magnetic order would be antiferromagnetic C- or A-type, rather than ferromagnetic. It is decisive that upon increasing the GdFeO3-type distortion, the nearest-neighbour hopping between the lowest and the upper-level Wannier functions becomes stronger than the hopping between the lowest-level Wannier functions. Finally, we show that the non-cubic perturbations responsible for this behaviour make it possible to unfold the orthorhombic t2g LDA bandstructure to a pseudo-cubic zone. In this zone, the lowest band is separated from the two others by a direct gap and has a width, WI, which is significantly smaller than that, W, of the entire t2g band. The progressive GdFeO3-type distortion thus favours electron localization by decreasing W, by increasing {$\Delta$}/W, and by decreasing WI/W. Our conclusions concerning the roles of GdFeO3-type and JT distortions agree with those of Mochizuki and Imada (2003 Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 167203).},

  abstract = {The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchange-correlation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density. It appears that SIC can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.},

We show that, the distributions of model errors being neither normal nor zero-centered, these error statistics cannot be used to infer prediction error probabilities. To overcome this limitation, we advocate for the use of more informative statistics, based on the empirical cumulative distribution function of unsigned errors, namely, (1) the probability for a new calculation to have an absolute error below a chosen threshold and (2) the maximal amplitude of errors one can expect with a chosen high confidence level. Those statistics are also shown to be well suited for benchmarking and ranking studies. Moreover, the standard error on all benchmarking statistics depends on the size of the reference dataset. Systematic publication of these standard errors would be very helpful to assess the statistical reliability of benchmarking conclusions.},

Doping factors from x=0 to 0.25 were examined. We found that a bond-centered stripe is the magnetic ground state for x=1/8 and 1/4. No stable stripe order was found for x=1/6. Analysis of the electron density revealed that apical oxygen atoms, those located above and below the copper atoms in the CuO2 planes, hold a non-negligible part of the holes at large doping and present a small spin polarization. Finally, the charge reorganization caused by the magnetic stripe modulation was studied for bond-centered and atom-centered stripes.},

The objective of our work has been to design an xc functional with broad accuracy across as wide an expanse of chemistry and physics as possible, leading\textemdash as a long-range goal\textemdash to a functional with good accuracy for all problems, i.e. a universal functional. To guide our path towards that goal and to measure our progress, we have developed\textemdash building on earlier work of our group\textemdash a set of databases of reference data for a variety of energetic and structural properties in chemistry and physics. These databases include energies of molecular processes, such as atomization, complexation, proton addition and ionization; they also include molecular geometries and solid-state lattice constants, chemical reaction barrier heights, and cohesive energies and band gaps of solids. For this paper, we gather many of these databases into four comprehensive databases, two with 384 energetic data for chemistry and solid-state physics and another two with 68 structural data for chemistry and solid-state physics, and we test two wave function methods and 77 density functionals (12 Minnesota meta functionals and 65 others) in a consistent way across this same broad set of data. We especially highlight the Minnesota density functionals, but the results have broader implications in that one may see the successes and failures of many kinds of density functionals when they are all applied to the same data. Therefore, the results provide a status report on the quest for a universal functional.},

  abstract = {Given access to accurate solutions of the many-electron Schr\textbackslash "odinger equation, nearly all chemistry could be derived from first principles. Exact wavefunctions of interesting chemical systems are out of reach because they are NP-hard to compute in general, but approximations can be found using polynomially-scaling algorithms. The key challenge for many of these algorithms is the choice of wavefunction approximation, or Ansatz, which must trade off between efficiency and accuracy. Neural networks have shown impressive power as accurate practical function approximators and promise as a compact wavefunction Ansatz for spin systems, but problems in electronic structure require wavefunctions that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Here we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, the Fermionic Neural Network, as a powerful wavefunction Ansatz for many-electron systems. The Fermionic Neural Network is able to achieve accuracy beyond other variational quantum Monte Carlo Ans\textbackslash "atze on a variety of atoms and small molecules. Using no data other than atomic positions and charges, we predict the dissociation curves of the nitrogen molecule and hydrogen chain, two challenging strongly-correlated systems, to significantly higher accuracy than the coupled cluster method, widely considered the most accurate scalable method for quantum chemistry at equilibrium geometry. This demonstrates that deep neural networks can improve the accuracy of variational quantum Monte Carlo to the point where it outperforms other ab-initio quantum chemistry methods, opening the possibility of accurate direct optimisation of wavefunctions for previously intractable molecules and solids.},

While the impact of external parameters such as doping or magnetic field can be conveniently modified and analyzed, the all-surface nature of the quasi-2D electron gas combined with its intricate internal properties pose a challenging task to characterize the quintessential nature of the different insulating and superconducting states found in experiments. We analyze the interplay of internal screening and dielectric environment on the intrinsic electronic interaction profile of MA-tBLG. We find that interlayer coupling generically enhances the internal screening. The influence of the dielectric environment on the effective interaction strength depends decisively on the electronic state of MA-tBLG. Thus, we propose the experimental tailoring of the dielectric environment, e.g., by varying the capping layer composition and thickness, as a promising pursuit to provide further evidence for resolving the hidden nature of the quantum many-body states in MA-tBLG.},

  abstract = {Correlated insulators and superconductivity have been observed in ``magic-angle'' twisted bilayer graphene, when the nearly flat bands close to neutrality are partially filled. While a momentum-space continuum model accurately describes these flat bands, interaction effects are more conveniently incorporated in tight-binding models. We have previously shown that no fully symmetric tight-binding model can be minimal, in the sense of capturing just the flat bands, so extended models are unavoidable. Here, we introduce a family of tight-binding models that capture the flat bands while simultaneously retaining all symmetries. In particular, we construct three concrete models with five, six, or ten bands per valley and per spin. These models are also faithful, in that the additional degrees of freedom represent energy bands further away from neutrality, and they serve as optimal starting points for a controlled study of interaction effects. Furthermore, our construction demonstrates the ``fragile topology'' of the nearly flat bands; i.e., the obstruction to constructing exponentially localized Wannier functions can be resolved when a particular set of trivial bands is added to the model.},

  abstract = {Photoemission experiments on early 3d transition metal compounds (TMC), involving both valence bands and core levels of the 3d elements, are reviewed. Extensive use is made of ab initio schemes as well as simple models and the emphasis is put on understanding the results of experiments more than on the experimental details and methods. Compounds of the TMs are first analyzed in terms of ab initio band structure calculations, which are shown to be usually sufficient as far as the interpretation of valence photoemission spectra is concerned. A discussion of ultraviolet valence band photoemission (UPS) and bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy (BIS) is also made. Other theories involving configuration interaction (CI) in the modelization are then shown to be necessary for an understanding of the core-level photoemission spectra and the observed satellite features. The electronic structure of a wide range of early TMCs, from Sc to Cr, is discussed by means of the CI cluster model analysis of the metal 2s-, 2p-, 3s- and 3p-level X-ray photoemission spectra (XPS). Early TMCs, like Ti, V, Cr oxides and halides (e.g. CrF3, CrCl3) have been originally regarded as typical Mott\textendash Hubbard (MH) systems. The MH model results from the electron correlations which dominate the inter-atomic overlaps that lead to bands. The concept of 3d-ligand orbital hybridization leads to the Zaanen\textendash Sawatsky\textendash Allen (ZSA) theory and to the charge transfer (CT) systems. Moreover, we discuss how the analysis of 3s XPS spectra can predict or not the formation of localized magnetic moments. The values of the charge transfer energy {$\Delta$} and d\textendash d Coulomb repulsion energy U point to systematic trends for the early TM compounds as found in the case of late TM compounds. Simple and competing mechanisms for the excitation of photoemission satellites are presented and the systematic trends for the compounds of the early TM series are discussed. Finally, in addition to the study of the above stoichiometric compounds, we review recent results on the electronic properties of substoichiometric binary alloy (TiNx, TiCx) by means of core and valence XPS spectra. Self-consistent ab initio calculations with empty spheres at the empty lattice ligand sites performed on these alloys provide the total densities of the occupied states to be compared with the observed valence XPS spectra. An extension of calculations to full potential methods is necessary for interpreting the elastic properties, e.g. the bulk modulus.},

Techniques are described for adjusting the trust region radius, and for choosing positions of the interpolation points that maintain not only nonsingularity of the interpolation equations but also the adequacy of the model. Particular attention is given to quadratic models with diagonal second derivative matrices, because numerical experiments show that they are often more efficient than full quadratic models for general objective functions. Finally, some recent research on the updating of full quadratic models is described briefly, using fewer interpolation equations than before. The resultant freedom is taken up by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the change to the second derivative matrix of the model. A preliminary version of this method provides some very promising numerical results.},

The calculations employ pseudopotentials and B-spline basis sets to expand the single particle orbitals used to construct the trial wave functions. Extensive tests on system size, time step, and other sources of errors, performed on periodically repeated systems of up to 1050 atoms, show that all these errors together can be reduced to below 10meV/f.u.. We find excellent agreement with the experiments for the equilibrium volume of both the Mg and the MgH2 crystals. The cohesive energy of the Mg crystal is found to be 1.51(1)eV and agrees perfectly with the experimental value of 1.51eV. The enthalpy of formation of MgH2 from Mg bulk and H2 gas is found to be 0.85{$\pm$}0.01eV/f.u., or 82{$\pm$}1kJ/mole, which is off the experimental one of 76.1{$\pm$}1kJ/mole only by 6kJ/mole. This shows that DMC can almost achieve chemical accuracy (1kcal/mole) on this system. Density functional theory errors are shown to be much larger and depend strongly on the functional employed.},

The static JT and s-wave type SC interactions in the conduction band are introduced in this model. The phonons are coupled to the conduction electron density as well as to the JT split conduction bands giving rise to DJT interaction, which is the main objective of this communication. The phonons are considered in a harmonic approximation. The phonon Green's function and hence the phonon self-energy arising due to normal electron-phonon (EP) interaction and DJT interaction are calculated using Zubarev's technique. The phonon self-energy is calculated from the electron response function in the coexistence phase of the two order parameters. Two excitation peaks due to the SC gap and the JT distortion are predicted by phonon density. The evolution of these excitation peaks are investigated by varying different model parameters of the system.},

  abstract = {In the quest for superconductors with higher transition temperatures (Tc), one emerging motif is that electronic interactions favorable for superconductivity can be enhanced by fluctuations of a broken-symmetry phase. Recent experiments have suggested the existence of the requisite broken-symmetry phase in the high-Tc cuprates, but the impact of such a phase on the ground-state electronic interactions has remained unclear. We used magnetic fields exceeding 90 tesla to access the underlying metallic state of the cuprate YBa2Cu3O6+{$\delta$} over a wide range of doping, and observed magnetic quantum oscillations that reveal a strong enhancement of the quasiparticle effective mass toward optimal doping. This mass enhancement results from increasing electronic interactions approaching optimal doping, and suggests a quantum critical point at a hole doping of pcrit {$\approx$} 0.18. Massive electrons signify correlations Thirty years on, and the mechanism of superconductivity in copper-oxide superconductors remains a mystery. Knowledge of their normal nonsuperconducting state is also incomplete; however, we do know that the more robust the superconductivity, the higher the magnetic fields required to suppress it. Ramshaw et al. studied samples of three different compositions of the copper-oxide YBa2Cu3O6+{$\delta$} in magnetic fields exceeding 90 T. They found that as the oxygen content increased toward the point of the maximum transition temperature, the conducting electrons became heavier and heavier. This mass enhancement reflected an increase in electronic correlations, which in turn may be a signature of a quantum critical point. Science, this issue p. 317},

However, the realization of high-Tc n-FMSs and p-FMSs in conventional high-symmetry semiconductors has proven extremely difficult due to the strongly coupled and interacting magnetic and semiconducting sublattices. Here we show that decoupling the two functional sublattices in the low-symmetry semiconductor FeBi2Se4 enables unprecedented coexistence of high n-type electrical conduction and ferromagnetism with Tc {$\approx$} 450 K. The structure of FeBi2Se4 consists of well-ordered magnetic sublattices built of [FenSe4n+2]{$\infty$} single-chain edge-sharing octahedra, coherently embedded within the three-dimensional Bi-rich semiconducting framework. Magnetotransport data reveal a negative magnetoresistance, indicating spin-polarization of itinerant conducting electrons. These findings demonstrate that decoupling magnetic and semiconducting sublattices allows access to high-Tc n- and p-FMSs as well as helps unveil the mechanism of carrier-mediated ferromagnetism in spintronic materials.},

On the other hand, recent developments in quantum computing theory prove that a general ground state search problem with two-body Hamiltonians cannot be solved in polynomial time. We suggest that a quantum chemical problem of the ground state energy search, with particles coupled via non-relativistic Coulomb operator, is also non-polynomial in time with respect to the system size. The consequences of this are explored, with an emphasis on the complexity of the quantum potential in quantum trajectory approach.},

  abstract = {We develop a formalism and present an algorithm for optimization of the trial wave function used in fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) methods. The formalism is based on the DMC mixed estimator of the ground-state probability density. We take advantage of a basic property of the walker configuration distribution generated in a DMC calculation, to (i) project out a multideterminant expansion of the fixed-node ground-state wave function and (ii) to define a cost function that relates the fixed-node ground-state and the noninteracting trial wave functions. We show that (a) locally smoothing out the kink of the fixed-node ground-state wave function at the node generates a new trial wave function with better nodal structure and (b) we argue that the noise in the fixed-node wave function resulting from finite sampling plays a beneficial role, allowing the nodes to adjust toward the ones of the exact many-body ground state in a simulated annealing-like process. Based on these principles, we propose a method to improve both single determinant and multideterminant expansions of the trial wave function. The method can be generalized to other wave-function forms such as pfaffians. We test the method in a model system where benchmark configuration-interaction calculations can be performed and most components of the Hamiltonian are evaluated analytically. Comparing the DMC calculations with the exact solutions, we find that the trial wave function is systematically improved. The overlap of the optimized trial wave function and the exact ground state converges to 100\% even starting from wave functions orthogonal to the exact ground state. Similarly, the DMC total energy and density converges to the exact solutions for the model. In the optimization process we find an optimal noninteracting nodal potential of density-functional-like form whose existence was predicted in a previous publication [Phys. Rev. B 77, 245110 (2008)]. Tests of the method are extended to a model system with a conventional Coulomb interaction where we show we can obtain the exact Kohn-Sham effective potential from the DMC data.},

We performed inelastic x-ray scattering experiments on crystals of graphite and applied reconstruction algorithms to image the dynamical screening of charge in a freestanding graphene sheet. We found that the polarizability of the Dirac fermions is amplified by excitonic effects, improving screening of interactions between quasiparticles. The strength of interactions is characterized by a scale-dependent, effective fine-structure constant, , the value of which approaches at low energy and large distances. This value is substantially smaller than the nominal , suggesting that, on the whole, graphene is more weakly interacting than previously believed.},

A previously unreported, subtle monoclinic distortion of the crystal structure away from the orthorhombic space group Bmab was detected. The distortion is also present in lightly Sr-doped crystals. A refinement of the crystal structure shows that the deviation from orthorhombic symmetry is predominantly determined to drive a continuous reorientation of the copper spins from the orthorhombic b axis to the c axis, directly confirming predictions based on prior magnetoresistance and Raman scattering experiments. A spin-flop transition induced by a c-axis oriented field previously reported for nonstoichiometric La2CuO4 is also observed, but the transition field (11.5 T) is significantly larger than that in the previous work.},

  abstract = {Materials properties are rooted in the atomic scale. Thus, an atomistic understanding of the physics and chemistry is the foundation of computational materials engineering. The MedeA computational environment provides a highly efficient platform for atomistic simulations to predict materials properties from the fundamental interactions effective at the nanoscale. Nevertheless, many interactions and processes occur at much larger time and length scales, that need to be described with microscale and macroscale models, as exemplified by the multiphase field tool MICRESS. The predictive power of these larger scale models can be greatly increased by augmenting them with atomistic simulation data. The notion of per phase-properties including their anisotropies provides e.g., the key for the determination of effective properties of multiphase materials. The key goal of the present work is to generate a common interface between atomistic and larger scale models using a data centric approach, in which the ``interface'' is provided by means of a standardized data structure based on the hierarchical data format HDF5. The example HDF5 file created by Schmitz et al., Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater. 17 (2016) 411, describing a three phase Al--Cu microstructure, is taken and extended to include atomistic simulation data of the Al--Cu phases, e.g., heats of formation, elastic properties, interfacial energies etc. This is pursued with special attention on using metadata to increase transparency and reproducibility of the data provided by the atomistic simulation tool MedeA.},

To this end the noninteracting Hamiltonian obtained within the LDA is expressed in Wannier function basis, with only the five antibonding bands with mainly Ni 3d character taken into account. Complementing it by local Coulomb interactions one arrives at a material-specific many-body Hamiltonian which is solved by DMFT together with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. The large insulating gap in NiO is found to be a result of the strong electronic correlations in the paramagnetic state. In the vicinity of the gap region, the shape of the electronic spectrum calculated in this way is in good agreement with the experimental x-ray-photoemission and bremsstrahlung-isochromat-spectroscopy results of Sawatzky and Allen. The value of the local magnetic moment computed in the paramagnetic phase (PM) agrees well with that measured in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase. Our results for the electronic spectrum and the local magnetic moment in the PM phase are in accordance with the experimental finding that AFM long-range order has no significant influence on the electronic structure of NiO.},

Once aligned, the magnetic moment can be reversed by applying a sufficiently large field in the opposite direction. These properties form the basis of most magnetic recording and storage devices. But the phenomenon of magnetization reversal in response to a change in temperature (in a small magnetic field) is rarer. This effect occurs in some ferrimagnetic materials consisting of two or more types of antiferromagnetically ordered magnetic ions, and forms the operational basis of ferrimagnetic insulators. Here we report the observation of multiple temperature-induced magnetization reversals in YVO3. The net magnetic moment is caused by a tilting of the antiferromagnetically aligned moments of (crystallographically identical) V3+ ions, due to orthorhombic distortion in the crystal structure. We observe an abrupt switching at 77 K associated with a first-order structural phase transition, and a gradual reversal at 95 K without an accompanying structural change. The magnetization always reverses if the crystal is cooled or warmed through these two temperatures in modest fields. We propose a possible mechanism involving a change in orbital ordering which may be generic to a broad class of transition metal oxides.},

  abstract = {The macroscopic electric polarization of a crystal is often defined as the dipole of a unit cell. In fact, such a dipole moment is ill defined, and the above definition is incorrect. Looking more closely, the quantity generally measured is differential polarization, defined with respect to a "reference state" of the same material. Such differential polarizations include either derivatives of the polarization (dielectric permittivity, Born effective charges, piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity) or finite differences (ferroelectricity). On the theoretical side, the differential concept is basic as well. Owing to continuity, a polarization difference is equivalent to a macroscopic current, which is directly accessible to the theory as a bulk property. Polarization is a quantum phenomenon and cannot be treated with a classical model, particularly whenever delocalized valence electrons are present in the dielectric. In a quantum picture, the current is basically a property of the phase of the wave functions, as opposed to the charge, which is a property of their modulus. An elegant and complete theory has recently been developed by King-Smith and Vanderbilt, in which the polarization difference between any two crystal states\textemdash in a null electric field\textemdash takes the form of a geometric quantum phase. The author gives a comprehensive account of this theory, which is relevant for dealing with transverse-optic phonons, piezoelectricity, and ferroelectricity. Its relation to the established concepts of linear-response theory is also discussed. Within the geometric phase approach, the relevant polarization difference occurs as the circuit integral of a Berry connection (or "vector potential"), while the corresponding curvature (or "magnetic field") provides the macroscopic linear response.},

For each molecule, relatively simple trial wave functions {$\Psi$} T are chosen. Each {$\Psi$} T consists of a single Slater determinant of molecular orbitals multiplied by a product of pair-correlation (Jastrow) functions. These wave functions are used as importance functions in a stochastic approach that solves the Schr\"odinger equation by treating it as a diffusion equation. In this approach, {$\Psi$} T serves as a ``guiding function'' for a random walk of the electrons through configuration space. In the fixed-node approximation used here, the diffusion process is confined to connected regions of space, bounded by the nodes (zeros) of {$\Psi$} T . This approximation simplifies the treatment of Fermi statistics, since within each region an electronic probability amplitude is obtained which does not change sign. Within these approximate boundaries, however, the Fermi problem is solved exactly. The energy obtained by this procedure is shown to be an upper bound to the true energy. For the molecular systems treated, at least as much of the correlation energy is accounted for with the relatively simple {$\Psi$} T 's used here as by the best configuration interaction calculations presently available.},

It is shown that an accuracy of 1\textendash 2\% can be achieved with setups applicable to larger molecules. The effect of frozen natural orbital approximation on the accuracy of composite CCSD(T)/CBS calculations is also quantified.

Particularly, the A1g symmetry revealed by polarization-dependent experiments and the comparison with the single-layered Bi2Sr2CuO6+x indicates that the oxygen dopant-induced states are mixed to the superconducting CuO2 planes through the oxygen dopant\textemdash apical oxygen O2pz\textemdash Cu3d3z2-r2 channel.},

At this angle the moir\textbackslash 'e states retain much of their isolated bilayer character, allowing their bilayer projections to be separately controlled by gates. We use this property to generate an energetic overlap between narrow isolated electron and hole bands with good nesting properties. Our measurements reveal the formation of ordered states with reconstructed Fermi surfaces, consistent with density-wave states, for equal electron and hole densities. These states can be tuned without introducing chemical dopants, thus opening the door to a new class of fundamental studies of density-waves and their interplay with superconductivity and other types of order, a central issue in quantum matter physics.},

Plane waves (PW) and atomic Gaussian-type orbitals (GTO) have been used to represent the electron density of the systems. It is shown that (i) for a given exchange-correlation potential, both PW and GTO basis sets provide an equivalent description; (ii) standard local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) methods predict an incorrect metallic ground state with a very poor spin density at Cu sites which is in contradiction to experimental evidence showing that these systems behave as charge transfer antiferromagnetic insulators with spin density localized mainly at the Cu sites; (iii) the introduction of an empirical on-site Hubbard term correction on the Cu(3d) levels using the LDA+U approach remedies some of the deficiencies of LDA and GGA (better spin localization and antiferromagnetic insulating ground state) but is not able to describe the charge-transfer nature of the insulating gap; and (iv) hybrid functionals including 20\textendash 25 \% of nonlocal Fock exchange provide a satisfactory picture of the electronic structure of these materials including a proper description of the charge-transfer antiferromagnetic character of these materials and provide reliable estimates of the band gap and magnetic coupling constant.},

For the undoped material, the charge-transfer antiferromagnetic character is properly reproduced. For the doped systems, a metallic character is predicted with the conduction band dominated by the O(2p) states, with doping having a small effect on the antiferromagnetic order of the Cu2+ cations within the CuO2 planes while maintaining the diamagnetic character in the rest of centers. The analysis of the spin density plots for the doped material evidences the appearance of a new feature reminiscent of the so-called Zhang-Rice singlet, thus providing unbiased independent support to the corresponding model Hamiltonian.

The analysis of the model is performed for d-dimensional hypercubic lattices, including d=1 and d={$\infty$}, by means of the (broken symmetry) Hartree-Fock approximations and, for d={$\infty$}, by the slave-boson mean-field method. For d=1, at half filling the phase diagram is shown to consist of nine different phases including two superconducting states with center-of-mass momentum q=0 and q=Q ({$\eta$} pairing), site and bond-located antiferromagnetic and charge-density wave states as well as three mixed phases with coexisting site and bond orderings. The stability range of the bond-type orderings shrinks with increasing lattice dimensionality d and for d={$\infty$} the corresponding diagram consists of four phases only, involving exclusively site-located orderings. Comparing the pair hopping model with the attractive Hubbard model we found in both cases gradual evolution from the BCS-like limit to the tightly bound pairs regime and a monotonic increase of the gap in the excitation spectrum with increasing coupling. However, the dynamics of electron pairs in both models is qualitatively different, which results in different dependences of condensation energies and critical temperatures on interaction parameters as well as in different electrodynamic properties, especially in a strong coupling regime.},

The new fermions are dual to the original ones and correspond to weakly interacting quasiparticles in the case of strong local correlations in the Hubbard model. The method starts with dynamical mean-field theory as a zeroth-order approximation and includes nonlocal effects in a perturbative way. In contrast to cluster approaches, this method utilizes an exact transition to a dual set of variables. It therefore becomes possible to treat vertices of an effective single-impurity problem as small parameters. This provides a very efficient interpolation between bandlike weak-coupling and atomic limits. The method is illustrated on the two-dimensional Hubbard model. The antiferromagnetic pseudogap, Fermi-arc formations, and non-Fermi-liquid effects due to the Van Hove singularity are correctly reproduced by the lowest-order diagrams. Extremum properties of the dual fermion approach are discussed in terms of the Feynman variational principle.},

  abstract = {Large pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 Tesla are used to suppress the contribution of superconducting fluctuations (SCF) to the ab-plane conductivity above Tc in a series of YBa2Cu3O6+x single crystals. The fluctuation conductivity is found to vanish nearly exponentially with temperature, allowing us to determine precisely the field H'c(T) and the temperature T'c above which the SCFs are fully suppressed. T'c is always found much smaller than the pseudogap temperature A careful investigation near optimal doping shows that T'c is higher than the pseudogap T*, which indicates that pseudogap cannot be assigned to preformed pairs. For nearly optimally doped samples, the fluctuation conductivity can be accounted for by gaussian fluctuations following the Ginzburg-Landau scheme. A phase fluctuation contribution might be invoked for the most underdoped samples in a T range which increases when controlled disorder is introduced by electron irradiation. Quantitative analysis of the fluctuating magnetoconductance allows us to determine the critical field Hc2(0) which is found to be quite similar to H'c(0) and to increase with hole doping. Studies of the incidence of disorder on both T'c and T* enable us to propose a three dimensional phase diagram including a disorder axis, which allows to explain most observations done in other cuprate families.},

We have developed a novel procedure for parametrizing the impurity Hamiltonian that avoids the mathematically uncontrolled step of constructing the low energy model system. Instead, the impurity Hamiltonian is immediately parametrized to recover the self-energy of the realistic system in the limit of high frequencies or short time. The effective interactions parametrizing the fictitious impurity Hamiltonian are local to the embedded regions, and include all the non-local interactions present in the original realistic Hamiltonian in an implicit way. We show that this impurity Hamiltonian can lead to excellent total energies and self-energies that approximate the quantities of the initial realistic system very well. Moreover, we show that as long as the effective impurity Hamiltonian parametrization is designed to recover the self-energy of the initial realistic system for high frequencies, we can expect a good total energy and self-energy. Finally, we propose two practical ways of evaluating effective integrals for parametrizing impurity models.},

This d symmetry implies the charge ordering is primarily on the bonds of the Cu lattice, and we propose incommensurate bond order parameters for the underdoped cuprates. The field theory for the onset of N\'eel order in a metal has an emergent pseudospin symmetry which ``rotates'' d-wave Cooper pairs to particle-hole pairs [M. A. Metlitski and S. Sachdev, Phys. Rev.

The author argues that many physical properties of the cuprates require interplay with additional order parameters associated with a proximate Mott insulator. A classification of Mott insulators in two dimensions is proposed. Experimental evidence so far shows that the class appropriate to the cuprates has collinear spin correlations, bond order, and confinement of neutral, spin S=1/2 excitations. Proximity to second-order quantum phase transitions associated with these orders, and with the pairing order of BCS, has led to systematic predictions for many physical properties. In this context the author reviews the results of recent neutron scattering, fluxoid detection, nuclear magnetic resonance, and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.},

We reveal the pseudogap in the electronic Raman spectra in the B1g and B2g geometries. In these geometries we probe respectively, the antinodal (AN) and nodal (N) regions corresponding to the principal axes and the diagonal of the Brillouin zone. The pseudogap appears in underdoped regime and manifests itself in the B1g spectra by a strong depletion of the low energy electronic continuum as the temperature decreases. We define a temperature T* below which the depletion appears and the pseudogap energy, {$\omega$}PG the energy at which the depeletion closes. The pseudogap is also present in the B2g spectra but the depletion opens at higher energy than in the B1g spectra. We observe the creation of new electronic states inside the depletion as we enter the superconducting phase. This leads us to conclude (as proposed by S. Sakai et al. [1]) that the pseudogap has a different structure than the superconducting gap and competes with it. We show that the nodal quasiparticle dynamic is very robust and almost insensitive to the pseudogap phase contrary to the antinodal quasiparticle dynamic. We finally reveal, in contrast to what it is usually admitted, an increase of the nodal quasiparticle spectral weight with underdoping. We interpret this result as the consequence of a possible Fermi surface disturbances in the doping range p = 0.1 - 0.2.},

  abstract = {As part of an ongoing investigation of students' learning in first semester upper-division quantum mechanics, we needed a high-quality conceptual assessment instrument for comparing outcomes of different curricular approaches. The process of developing such a tool started with converting a preliminary version of a 14-item open-ended quantum mechanics assessment tool (QMAT) to a multiple-choice (MC) format. Further question refinement, development of effective distractors, adding new questions, and robust statistical analysis has led to a 31-item quantum mechanics concept assessment (QMCA) test. The QMCA is used as post-test only to assess students' knowledge about five main topics of quantum measurement: the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation, wave functions and boundary conditions, time evolution, and probability density. During two years of testing and refinement, the QMCA has been given in alpha (N=61) and beta versions (N=263) to students in upper division quantum mechanics courses at 11 different institutions with an average post-test score of 54\%. By allowing for comparisons of student learning across different populations and institutions, the QMCA provides instructors and researchers a more standard measure of effectiveness of different curricula or teaching strategies on student conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we discuss the construction of effective distractors and the use of student interviews and expert feedback to revise and validate both questions and distractors. We include the results of common statistical tests of reliability and validity, which suggest the instrument is presently in a stable, usable, and promising form.},

Physically, this is shown to come from a unified picture in which higher Tc is achieved with an ``orbital distillation,'' namely, the less the dx2-y2 main band is hybridized with the dz2 and 4s orbitals the higher the Tc. Some implications for obtaining higher Tc materials are discussed.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen is an ideal energy carrier which is considered for future transport, such as automotive applications. In this context storage of hydrogen is one of the key challenges in developing hydrogen economy. The relatively advanced storage methods such as high-pressure gas or liquid cannot fulfill future storage goals. Chemical or physically combined storage of hydrogen in other materials has potential advantages over other storage methods. Intensive research has been done on metal hydrides recently for improvement of hydrogenation properties. The present review reports recent developments of metal hydrides on properties including hydrogen-storage capacity, kinetics, cyclic behavior, toxicity, pressure and thermal response. A group of Mg-based hydrides stand as promising candidate for competitive hydrogen storage with reversible hydrogen capacity up to 7.6\&\#xa0;wt\% for on-board applications. Efforts have been devoted to these materials to decrease their desorption temperature, enhance the kinetics and cycle life. The kinetics has been improved by adding an appropriate catalyst into the system and as well as by ball-milling that introduces defects with improved surface properties. The studies reported promising results, such as improved kinetics and lower decomposition temperatures, however, the state-of-the-art materials are still far from meeting the aimed target for their transport applications. Therefore, further research work is needed to achieve the goal by improving development on hydrogenation, thermal and cyclic behavior of metal hydrides.},

We have observed several features near 12 000 cm-1 ({$\sim$}1.5 eV) with A2g, B1g, and A1g symmetry. At low temperatures, the largest feature with A2g symmetry splits in all the insulating cuprates into three distinct peaks: a strong main peak, and two weaker sidebands offset approximately 600 and 1500 cm-1 higher in energy, respectively. A B1g feature coinciding in position with the optical conductivity peak is observed in all the T' phase materials, but not in the other insulators. An A1g peak is observed in Gd2CuO4 and Eu2CuO4 40\textendash 50 cm-1 lower in energy than the main A2g peak, and in YBa2Cu3O6 around 2400 cm-1 above the main A2g peak. All of these features have unusual, temperature-dependent resonance behavior with the incident photon energy. We propose explanations for many of the above observations involving copper d2x-y2 to dxy hole transitions enabled by coupling to oxygen p{$\sigma$} and p{$\pi$} levels.},

DMC agrees with experimental measurements to within 0.3 eV, including the band-gap of ZnO, the ionization potential of O and Zn, and the atomization energy of O2, ZnO dimer, and wurtzite ZnO. DMC predicts the oxygen vacancy as a deep donor with a formation energy of 5.0(2) eV under O-rich conditions and thermodynamic transition levels located between 1.8 and 2.5 eV from the valence band maximum. Our DMC results indicate that the concentration of zinc interstitial and hydrogen impurities in ZnO should be low under n-type and Zn- and H-rich conditions because these defects have formation energies above 1.4 eV under these conditions. Comparison of DMC and hybrid functionals shows that these DFT approximations can be parameterized to yield a general correct qualitative description of ZnO. However, the formation energy of defects in ZnO evaluated with DMC and hybrid functionals can differ by more than 0.5 eV.},

However, depending on both the properties of interest as well as particular chemical/structural phase space, accuracy even for correct trends remains a key challenge for DFT. In this work, we evaluate the use of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to calculate material formation energies in a high-throughput environment. We test the performance of automated QMC calculations on 21 compounds with high quality reference data from the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) thermodynamic database. We compare our approach to different DFT methods as well as different pseudopotentials, showing that errors in QMC calculations can be progressively improved especially when correct pseudopotentials are used. We determine a set of accurate pseudopotentials in QMC via systematical investigation of multiple pseudopotential libraries available. We show that using this simple automated recipe, QMC calculations can outperform DFT calculations over a wide set of materials. Out of 21 compounds tested, chemical accuracy has been obtained in formation energies of 11 structures using our QMC recipe, compared to none using DFT calculations.},

This paper compares compressed hydrogen, cryogenic hydrogen and metal hydride (Mg and FeTi) options using net energy analysis. A simulation of an Indian vehicle with an urban drive cycle using a fuel cell stack is carried out to determine the total hydrogen required per km of travel. Net energy analysis is carried out considering the energy requirements of the storage device and the energy required to produce and store the hydrogen. From net energy analysis compressed hydrogen is the preferred option. The direct energy requirement is more than 55\% for magnesium hydride as compared to compressed hydrogen due to the combined effect of increase in weight and higher heat of desorption. In addition to volumetric and gravimetric storage density, it is felt that net energy analysis should be also included as an additional criteria for evaluating any storage option. For metal hydride storage the net energy required to produce the tank should be minimum. This could be used as a selection criterion to design an optimum metal hydride storage. The performance of other materials like porous carbon, carbon nanotubes and hybrids can be evaluated using net energy analysis.},

Unlike conventional density functional theory and some hybrid functionals, fixed node diffusion Monte Carlo finds the rocksalt structure to be more stable than the zinc-blende structure, and thus recovers the correct energy ordering. Analysis of the site-resolved charge fluctuations of the wave functions according to DMC and other electronic structure descriptions gives insights into elements that are missing in other theories. While the calculated band gaps within DMC are in agreement with predictions that the zinc-blende polymorph has a lower band gap, the gaps themselves overestimate reported experimental values.},

However, for detailed quantitative understanding, the nature of the high-pressure environment acting on the sample must be well defined, a requirement often not met. Since HTS are quasi-2D, all properties are anisotropic. As a result, only a combination of fully hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure experiments are capable of providing the detailed information required. Unfortunately, very few such experiments have been carried out. For both Cu-oxide and Fe-based HTS at optimal doping, Tc is found to be enhanced by either increasing the separation of the superconducting planes or decreasing their area. Future experiments will extend such hydrostatic/uniaxial studies over the entire doping range.},

The moment-based approach is based on the maximum entropy and kernel polynomial methods for constructing the electronic density of states from local statistical information about the environment around individual atoms. Random-walk statistics are formally presented as the basis for several methods to collect the moments of the density of states in a computationally efficient manner. The computational complexity and accuracy of these methods are systematically analyzed. Using these methods for the problem of deformed carbon nanotubes, it is shown that the computational cost for some cases, per atom, scales as efficiently as O(MlogM), where M is the desired number of moments in the expansion of the density of states. These methods are compared to other methods such as direct diagonalization and a Green's function approach.},

  abstract = {Better living through water-splitting Chemists have known how to use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for more than 200 years. Nonetheless, because the electrochemical route is inefficient, most of the hydrogen made nowadays comes from natural gas. Seh et al. review recent progress in electrocatalyst development to accelerate water-splitting, the reverse reactions that underlie fuel cells, and related oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide reductions. A unified theoretical framework highlights the need for catalyst design strategies that selectively stabilize distinct reaction intermediates relative to each other. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad4998 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDWith a rising global population, increasing energy demands, and impending climate change, major concerns have been raised over the security of our energy future. Developing sustainable, fossil-free pathways to produce fuels and chemicals of global importance could play a major role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions while providing the feedstocks needed to make the products we use on a daily basis. One prospective goal is to develop electrochemical conversion processes that can convert molecules in the atmosphere (e.g., water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen) into higher-value products (e.g., hydrogen, hydrocarbons, oxygenates, and ammonia) by coupling to renewable energy. Electrocatalysts play a key role in these energy conversion technologies because they increase the rate, efficiency, and selectivity of the chemical transformations involved. Today's electrocatalysts, however, are inadequate. The grand challenge is to develop advanced electrocatalysts with the enhanced performance needed to enable widespread penetration of clean energy technologies. ADVANCESOver the past decade, substantial progress has been made in understanding several key electrochemical transformations, particularly those that involve water, hydrogen, and oxygen. The combination of theoretical and experimental studies working in concert has proven to be a successful strategy in this respect, yielding a framework to understand catalytic trends that can ultimately provide rational guidance toward the development of improved catalysts. Catalyst design strategies that aim to increase the number of active sites and/or increase the intrinsic activity of each active site have been successfully developed. The field of hydrogen evolution, for example, has seen important breakthroughs over the years in the development of highly active non\textendash precious metal catalysts in acid. Notable advancements have also been made in the design of oxygen reduction and evolution catalysts, although there remains substantial room for improvement. The combination of theory and experiment elucidates the remaining challenges in developing further improved catalysts, often involving scaling relations among reactive intermediates. This understanding serves as an initial platform to design strategies to circumvent technical obstacles, opening up opportunities and approaches to develop higher-performance electrocatalysts for a wide range of reactions. OUTLOOKA systematic framework of combining theory and experiment in electrocatalysis helps to uncover broader governing principles that can be used to understand a wide variety of electrochemical transformations. These principles can be applied to other emerging and promising clean energy reactions, including hydrogen peroxide production, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction, among others. Although current paradigms for catalyst development have been helpful to date, a number of challenges need to be successfully addressed in order to achieve major breakthroughs. One important frontier, for example, is the development of both experimental and computational methods that can rapidly elucidate reaction mechanisms on broad classes of materials and in a wide range of operating conditions (e.g., pH, solvent, electrolyte). Such efforts would build on current frameworks for understanding catalysis to provide the deeper insights needed to fine-tune catalyst properties in an optimal manner. The long-term goal is to continue improving the activity and selectivity of these catalysts in order to realize the prospects of using renewable energy to provide the fuels and chemicals that we need for a sustainable energy future. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/355/6321/eaad4998/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Electrochemical energy conversion.Schematic showing electrochemical conversion of water, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen into value-added products (e.g., hydrogen, hydrocarbons, oxygenates, and ammonia), using energy from renewable sources. The combination of theoretical and experimental studies working in concert provides us with insight into these electrochemical transformations and guides the development of the high-performance electrocatalysts needed to enable these technologies. Electrocatalysis plays a central role in clean energy conversion, enabling a number of sustainable processes for future technologies. This review discusses design strategies for state-of-the-art heterogeneous electrocatalysts and associated materials for several different electrochemical transformations involving water, hydrogen, and oxygen, using theory as a means to rationalize catalyst performance. By examining the common principles that govern catalysis for different electrochemical reactions, we describe a systematic framework that clarifies trends in catalyzing these reactions, serving as a guide to new catalyst development while highlighting key gaps that need to be addressed. We conclude by extending this framework to emerging clean energy reactions such as hydrogen peroxide production, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction, where the development of improved catalysts could allow for the sustainable production of a broad range of fuels and chemicals.},

This state does not invoke global charge order but breaks C4 rotational and inversion symmetry. The incommensurability of the low doping charge-disordered state is in good agreement with experiment and interpolates smoothly with the incommensurability of the stripe phase at higher doping. Within linear spin-wave theory the dynamic structure factor is in very good agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data and can account for the observed energy dependent anisotropy.},

Our analyses indicate that the conductivity correlates with structurally driven changes in both the electrostatic potential and the local electronic structure, which shows a decrease in the bandgap at the domain wall.

In particular, we found that the formation of neutral Hf- and Zr-vacancy pairs is energetically favorable in both solids; these defects have spin-triplet ground states, with electronic structures similar to those of the diamond nitrogen-vacancy center and the SiC divacancy. Interestingly, they exhibit different spin-strain coupling characteristics, and the nature of heavy metal ions may allow for easy defect implantation in desired lattice locations and ensure stability against defect diffusion. To support future experimental identification of the proposed defects, we report predictions of their optical zero-phonon line, zero-field splitting, and hyperfine parameters. The defect design concept identified here may be generalized to other binary semiconductors to facilitate the exploration of new solid-state qubits.},

This involves using a quasi-density matrix, to ensure that the renormalized DMRG states are eigenfunctions of 2, and the Wigner-Eckart theorem, to reduce overall storage and computational costs. We argue that the spin-adapted DMRG algorithm is most advantageous for low spin states. Consequently, we also implement a singlet-embedding strategy due to Tatsuaki [Phys. Rev. E 61, 3199 (2000)]10.1103/PhysRevE.61.3199 where we target high spin states as a component of a larger fictitious singlet system. Finally, we present an efficient algorithm to calculate one- and two-body reduced density matrices from the spin-adapted wavefunctions. We evaluate our developments with benchmark calculations on transition metal system active space models. These include the Fe2S2, [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2-, and Cr2 systems. In the case of Fe2S2, the spin-ladder spacing is on the microHartree scale, and here we show that we can target such very closely spaced states. In [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]2-, we calculate particle and spin correlation functions, to examine the role of sulfur bridging orbitals in the electronic structure. In Cr2 we demonstrate that spin-adaptation with the Wigner-Eckart theorem and using singlet embedding can yield up to an order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency. Overall, these calculations demonstrate the potential of using spin-adaptation to extend the range of DMRG calculations in complex transition metal problems.},

  abstract = {We present an implementation of phaseless Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) utilizing graphical processing units (GPUs). The AFQMC method is recast in terms of matrix operations which are spread across thousands of processing cores and are executed in batches using custom Compute Unified Device Architecture kernels and the GPU-optimized cuBLAS matrix library. Algorithmic advances include a batched Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury algorithm to quickly update matrix determinants and inverses, density-fitting of the two-electron integrals, an energy algorithm involving a high-dimensional precomputed tensor, and the use of single-precision floating point arithmetic. These strategies accelerate ph-AFQMC calculations with both single- and multideterminant trial wave functions, though particularly dramatic wall-time reductions are achieved for the latter. For typical calculations we find speed-ups of roughly 2 orders of magnitude using just a single GPU card compared to a single modern CPU core. Furthermore, we achieve near-unity parallel efficiency using 8 GPU cards on a single node and can reach moderate system sizes via a local memory-slicing approach. We illustrate the robustness of our implementation on hydrogen chains of increasing length and through the calculation of all-electron ionization potentials of the first-row transition metal atoms. We compare long imaginary-time calculations utilizing a population control algorithm with our previously published correlated sampling approach and show that the latter improves not only the efficiency but also the accuracy of the computed ionization potentials. Taken together, the GPU implementation combined with correlated sampling provides a compelling computational method that will broaden the application of ph-AFQMC to the description of realistic correlated electronic systems.},

Experimental signatures of the QSH effect have recently been reported in an atomically thin material, monolayer WTe2. Here, we directly image the local conductivity of monolayer WTe2 using microwave impedance microscopy, establishing beyond doubt that conduction is indeed strongly localized to the physical edges at temperatures up to 77 K and above. The edge conductivity shows no gap as a function of gate voltage, and is suppressed by magnetic field as expected. We observe additional conducting features which can be explained by edge states following boundaries between topologically trivial and nontrivial regions. These observations will be critical for interpreting and improving the properties of devices incorporating WTe2. Meanwhile, they reveal the robustness of the QSH channels and the potential to engineer them in the monolayer material platform.

The path-integrals can be evaluated by Monte Carlo, via random walks of HFB wave functions whose orbitals evolve stochastically. The approach combines the advantage of HFB theory in paired fermion systems and many-body quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques. The properties of HFB states, written in the form of either product states or Thouless states, are discussed. The states are shown to be propagated by generalized one-body operators. The states can be stabilized for numerical iteration, and overlaps between two such states and one-body Green's functions can be computed. A constrained-path or phaseless approximation can be applied to the random walks of the HFB states if a sign problem or phase problem is present. The method is illustrated with an exact numerical projection in the Kitaev model, and in the Hubbard model with attractive interaction under an external pairing field.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}br/{$>$}Total energy calculation is common in the field of materials science. However, in view of design for hydrogen storage materials, information is still limited about the role of each constituent element in them. In this paper, a unified approach based on the atomization energy concept is proposed for understanding the chemical bond in hydrides without using the standard concept of covalent and ionic bonds. The atomization energies, [Delta]EH for the hydrogen atom and [Delta]EM for the metal atom in each hydride, are evaluated using the energy density analysis of the total energy, and an [Delta]EH vs. [Delta]EM diagram is constructed. All the hydrides, including complex hydrides and metal hydrides, can be located on this diagram, although there are significant differences in the nature of the chemical bond among them. Also, for hydrocarbons, CmHn, the atomization energy for carbon, [Delta]EC, increases linearly with the ratio of carbon number to hydrogen number, m/n, while keeping [Delta]EH constant.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The heavy electron Kondo liquid is an emergent state of condensed matter that displays universal behavior independent of material details. Properties of the heavy electron liquid are best probed by NMR Knight shift measurements, which provide a direct measure of the behavior of the heavy electron liquid that emerges below the Kondo lattice coherence temperature as the lattice of local moments hybridizes with the background conduction electrons. Because the transfer of spectral weight between the localized and itinerant electronic degrees of freedom is gradual, the Kondo liquid typically coexists with the local moment component until the material orders at low temperatures. The two-fluid formula captures this behavior in a broad range of materials in the paramagnetic state. In order to investigate two-fluid behavior and the onset and physical origin of different long range ordered ground states in heavy electron materials, we have extended Knight shift measurements to URu2Si2, CeIrIn5, and CeRhIn5. In CeRhIn5 we find that the antiferromagnetic order is preceded by a relocalization of the Kondo liquid, providing independent evidence for a local moment origin of antiferromagnetism. In URu2Si2 the hidden order is shown to emerge directly from the Kondo liquid and so is not associated with local moment physics. Our results imply that the nature of the ground state is strongly coupled with the hybridization in the Kondo lattice in agreement with phase diagram proposed by Yang and Pines.},

We show that, on average, the accuracy is comparable to or better than that of DFT when using the new generation of functionals, including one hybrid functional and two dispersion corrected functionals. The excellent performance of quantum Monte Carlo on solids is promising for its application to heterogeneous systems and high-pressure/high-density conditions. Important to the results here is the application of a consistent procedure with regards to the several approximations that are made, such as finite-size corrections and pseudopotential approximations.

  abstract = {The existence of the mysterious pseudo-gap state in the phase diagram of copper oxide superconductors and its interplay with unconventional d-wave superconductivity has been a long standing issue for more than a decade. There is now a growing number of experimental indications that the pseudo-gap phase actually corresponds to a symmetry breaking state. In his theory for cuprates, C. M. Varma proposes that the pseudo-gap is a new state of matter associated with the spontaneous appearance of circulating current loops within CuO2 unit cell. This intra-unit-cell order breaks time reversal symmetry, but preserves lattice translation invariance. Polarized elastic neutron scattering measurements provide evidence for an intra-unit-cell magnetic order inside the pseudo-gap state. This order could be produced by the orbital-like magnetic moments induced by the circulating current loops. The magnetic order displays the same characteristic features in HgBa2CuO4+{$\delta$}, YBa2Cu3O6+x and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{$\delta$} demonstrating that this genuine phase is ubiquitous of the pseudo-gap of high temperature copper oxide materials. We review the main properties characterizing this intra-unit-cell magnetic order and discuss its interplay or competition with other spin and charge instabilities.},

  abstract = {Widespread adoption of superconducting technologies awaits the discovery of new materials with enhanced properties, especially higher superconducting transition temperatures Tc. The unexpected discovery of high Tc superconductivity in cuprates suggests that the highest Tcs occur when pressure or doping transform the localized and moment-bearing electrons in antiferromagnetic insulators into itinerant carriers in a metal, where magnetism is preserved in the form of strong correlations. The absence of this transition in Fe-based superconductors may limit their Tcs, but even larger Tcs may be possible in their isostructural Mn analogs, which are antiferromagnetic insulators like the cuprates. It is generally believed that prohibitively large pressures would be required to suppress the effects of the strong Hund's rule coupling in these Mn-based compounds, collapsing the insulating gap and enabling superconductivity. Indeed, no Mn-based compounds are known to be superconductors. The electronic structure calculations and X-ray diffraction measurements presented here challenge these long held beliefs, finding that only modest pressures are required to transform LaMnPO, isostructural to superconducting host LaFeAsO, from an antiferromagnetic insulator to a metallic antiferromagnet, where the Mn moment vanishes in a second pressure-driven transition. Proximity to these charge and moment delocalization transitions in LaMnPO results in a highly correlated metallic state, the familiar breeding ground of superconductivity.},

We describe the crystal structure and normal-state properties of the organics, before presenting the experimental evidence for and against exotic superconductivity mediated by antiferromagnetic fluctuations.

Our results indicate that peer discussion enhances understanding, even when none of the students in a discussion group originally knows the correct answer.

  abstract = {The electronic and magnetic properties of many strongly correlated systems are controlled by a limited number of states, located near the Fermi level and well isolated from the rest of the spectrum. This opens a formal way for combining the methods of first-principles electronic structure calculations, based on the density-functional theory (DFT), with many-body models, formulated in the restricted Hilbert space of states close to the Fermi level. The core of this project is the so-called `realistic modeling' or the construction of the many-body model Hamiltonian entirely from first principles. Such a construction should be able to go beyond the conventional local-density approximation (LDA), which typically supplements the density-functional theory, and incorporate the physics of Coulomb correlations. It should also provide a transparent physical picture for the low-energy properties of strongly correlated materials. In this review article, we will outline the basic ideas of such a realistic modeling, which consists of the following steps: (i) the construction of the complete Wannier basis set for the low-energy LDA band; (ii) the construction of the one-electron part of the model Hamiltonian in this Wannier basis; (iii) the calculation of the screened Coulomb interactions for the low-energy bands by means of the constrained DFT. The most difficult part of this project is the evaluation of the screening caused by outer bands, which may have the same (e.g., the transition-metal 3d) character as the low-energy bands. The latter part can be efficiently done by combining the constrained DFT with the random-phase approximation (RPA) for the screened Coulomb interaction. The entire procedure will be illustrated on a series of examples, including the distorted transition-metal perovskite oxides, compounds with the inversion-symmetry breaking caused by the defects, and the alkali hyperoxide KO2, which can be regarded as an analog of strongly correlated systems where the localized electrons reside on the molecular orbitals of the O2- dimer. In order to illustrate the abilities of the realistic modeling, we will also consider solutions of the low-energy models obtained for a number of systems, and argue that it can be used as a powerful tool for the exploration and understanding of the properties of strongly correlated materials.},

The analysis is based on comparison with experimental magnetic, optical, and photoemission data. Parameters of the effective Coulomb interaction estimated for t2g electrons and a role of eg screening are discussed. The present approach accounts well for the insulating natures of LaTiO3, LaVO3, and LaCoO3, for which the LSDA predicts metallic states. Changes of the LSDA band structure for LaMnO3 and LaNiO3 are almost negligible due to the very efficient screening of on-site t2g interactions by eg electrons. \textcopyright{} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

Twin boundaries run at approximately 45\textdegree{} to the Fe-Fe bond directions, and noticeably suppress the superconducting gap, in contrast with the recent experimental and theoretical findings in other iron pnictides. Furthermore, vortices appear to accumulate on twin boundaries, consistent with the degraded superconductivity there.

Indeed, by using a very efficient statistical evaluation of the first and the second energy derivatives, it is possible to define a very rapidly converging iterative scheme that, within VMC, is much more convenient than the standard Newton method. It is also shown how to optimize simultaneously both the Jastrow and the determinantal part of the wave function.},

Therefore there is a need for numerical schemes that are capable of accurately and efficiently integrating systems of SDEs. In this work we introduce a variable size step algorithm and apply it to systems of stiff SDEs with multiple multiplicative noise. The algorithm is validated using a subclass of SDEs called chemical Langevin equations that appear in the description of dilute chemical kinetics models, with important applications mainly in biology. Three representative examples are used to test and report on the behavior of the proposed scheme. We demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages over fixed time step integration schemes of the proposed method, showing that the adaptive time step method is considerably more stable than fixed step methods with no excessive additional computational overhead.},

The central quantity is a cumulant generating function, which yields, upon successive differentiation, all the cumulants and moments of the probability distribution of the center of mass X/N of the electrons, defined appropriately to remain valid for extended systems obeying twisted boundary conditions. The first moment is the average polarization, where we recover the well-known Berry phase expression. The second cumulant gives the mean-square fluctuation of the polarization, which defines an electronic localization length {$\xi$}i along each direction i: {$\xi$}i2=({$\langle$}Xi2{$\rangle$}-{$\langle$}Xi{$\rangle$}2)/N. It follows from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem that in the thermodynamic limit {$\xi$}i diverges for metals and is a finite, measurable quantity for insulators. In noninteracting systems {$\xi$}i2 is related to the spread of the Wannier functions. It is possible to define for correlated insulators maximally localized ``many-body Wannier functions,'' which for large N become localized in disconnected regions of the high-dimensional configuration space, establishing a direct connection with Kohn's theory of the insulating state. Interestingly, the expression for {$\xi$}i2, which involves the second derivative of the wave function with respect to the boundary conditions, is directly analogous to Kohn's formula for the ``Drude weight'' as the second derivative of the energy.},

Spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity in CeCu2Si2 was demonstrated by inelastic neutron scattering to exist in the vicinity of a spin-density-wave (SDW) quantum critical point (QCP). The isostructural HF compound YbRh2Si2 which is prototypical for a Kondo-breakdown QCP has so far not shown any sign of superconductivity down to T {$\approx$} 10 mK. In contrast, results of de-Haas-van-Alphen experiments by Shishido et al. (J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 74, 1103 (2005)) suggest superconductivity in CeRhIn5 close to an antiferromagnetic QCP beyond the SDW type, at which the Kondo effect breaks down. For the related compound CeCoIn5 however, a field-induced QCP of SDW type is extrapolated to exist inside the superconducting phase.},

Furthermore, by using the so-called ``modern theory of polarization'' and by studying the spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlations functions, we have characterized in detail the crossover between the weakly and strongly correlated regimes of this atomic chain.

Tuning electron-electron inter-actions in MAG would shed light on the individual roles of these phases and their intri-cate relationship. Here we report on a new method to control electronic interactions in a correlated system, by varying the separation of a metallic screening layer in ultra-close proximity to a MAG layer. We observe that correlated insulators disappear when the separation becomes smaller than the extent of Wannier orbitals, w {$<$} 15nm, consistent with the expected screening of Coulomb interactions. The superconducting phase re-mains resilient under screening, taking over the phase space vacated by correlated insu-lators and showing critical temperatures comparable to those in unscreened devices. However, even under screening, correlated insulators reappear at half-filling upon applying small out-of-plane magnetic field {$>$} 0.5 tesla, exhibiting Chern bands with quan-tized Hall resistance of h/2e2 consistent with orbital magnetism. Our study establishes direct and independent control of the insulating and superconducting phases, pointing to their possibly distinct microscopic origin. The re-examination of the often-assumed mother-child relation between these phases, triggered by these observations, illustrates a new technique to directly probe microscopic mechanisms of anomalous superconductivity in MAG and other strongly-correlated systems.},

  abstract = {Despite the great success that theoretical approaches based on density functional theory have in describing properties of solid compounds, accurate predictions of the enthalpies of formation ({$\Delta$}Hf) of insulating and semiconducting solids still remain a challenge. This is mainly due to incomplete error cancellation when computing the total energy differences between the compound total energy and the total energies of its elemental constituents. In this paper we present an approach based on GGA + U calculations, including the spin-orbit coupling, which involves fitted elemental-phase reference energies (FERE) and which significantly improves the error cancellation resulting in accurate values for the compound enthalpies of formation. We use an extensive set of 252 binary compounds with measured {$\Delta$}Hf values (pnictides, chalcogenides, and halides) to obtain FERE energies and show that after the fitting, the 252 enthalpies of formation are reproduced with the mean absolute error MAE=0.054 eV/atom instead of MAE{$\approx$}0.250 eV/atom resulting from pure GGA calculations. When applied to a set of 55 ternary compounds that were not part of the fitting set the FERE method reproduces their enthalpies of formation with MAE=0.048 eV/atom. Furthermore, we find that contributions to the total energy differences coming from the spin-orbit coupling can be, to a good approximation, separated into purely atomic contributions which do not affect {$\Delta$}Hf. The FERE method, hence, represents a simple and general approach, as it is computationally equivalent to the cost of pure GGA calculations and applies to virtually all insulating and semiconducting compounds, for predicting compound {$\Delta$}Hf values with chemical accuracy. We also show that by providing accurate {$\Delta$}Hf the FERE approach can be applied for accurate predictions of the compound thermodynamic stability or for predictions of Li-ion battery voltages.},

  abstract = {Ab initio wave-function-based methods are employed for the study of quasiparticle energy bands of zinc-blende ZnS, with focus on the Zn 3d "semicore" states. The relative energies of these states with respect to the top of the S 3p valence bands appear to be poorly described as compared to experimental values not only within the local density approximation (LDA), but also when many-body corrections within the GW approximation are applied to the LDA or LDA+U mean-field solutions [T. Miyake, P. Zhang, M. L. Cohen, and S. G. Louie, Phys. Rev. B 74, 245213 (2006)]. In the present study, we show that for the accurate description of the Zn 3d states a correlation treatment based on wave function methods is needed. Our study rests on a local Hamiltonian approach which rigorously describes the short-range polarization and charge redistribution effects around an extra hole or electron placed into the valence respective conduction bands of semiconductors and insulators. The method also facilitates the computation of electron correlation effects beyond relaxation and polarization. The electron correlation treatment is performed on finite clusters cut off the infinite system. The formalism makes use of localized Wannier functions and embedding potentials derived explicitly from prior periodic Hartree-Fock calculations. The on-site and nearest-neighbor charge relaxation lead to corrections of several eV to the Hartree-Fock band energies and gap. Corrections due to long-range polarization are of the order of 1.0 eV. The dispersion of the Hartree-Fock bands is only little affected by electron correlations. We find the Zn 3d "semicore" states to lie about 9.0 eV below the top of the S 3p valence bands, in very good agreement with values from valence-band x-ray photoemission.},

The influence of the following parameters is investigated in a systematic way: sample thickness, impurity content, illumination time, light intensity, photon energy, and illumination and annealing temperatures. The experimental results can be explained quantitatively by a model based on the nonradiative recombination of photoexcited carriers as the defect-creating step. In the framework of this model, the Staebler-Wronski effect is an intrinsic, self-limiting bulk process, characterized by a strongly sublinear dependence on the total light exposure of a sample. The experimental results suggest that the metastable changes are caused by recombination-induced breaking of weak Si\textendash Si bonds, rather than by trapping of excess carriers in already existing defects. Hydrogen could be involved in the microscopic mechanism as a stabilizing element. The main metastable defect created by prolonged illumination is the silicon dangling bond. An analysis of the annealing behavior shows that a broad distribution of metastable dangling bonds exists, characterized by a variation of the energy barrier separating the metastable state from the stable ground state between 0.9 and 1.3 eV.},

  abstract = {The role of various techniques for visualization of high-dimensional data is demonstrated in the context of combinatorial high-throughput experimentation (HTE). Applying visualization tools, we identify which constituents of catalysts are associated with final products in a huge combinatorially generated data set of heterogeneous catalysts, and catalytic activity regions are identified with respect to pentanary composition spreads of catalysts. A radial visualization scheme directly visualizes pentanary composition spreads in two-dimensional (2D) space and catalytic activity of a final product by combining high-throughput results from five slate libraries. A glyph plot provides many possibilities for visualizing high-dimensional data with interactive tools. For catalyst discovery and lead optimization, this work demonstrates how large multidimensional catalysis data sets are visualized in terms of quantitative composition activity relationships (QCAR) to effectively identify the relevant key role of compositions (i.e., lead compositions) of catalysts.},

Although many books currently exist on general concepts of PV and inorganic PV materials and devices, few are available that offer a comprehensive overview of recently fast developing organic and polymeric PV materials and devices. Organic Photovoltaics: Mechanisms, Materials, and Devices fills this gap. The book provides an international perspective on the latest research in this rapidly expanding field with contributions from top experts around the world. It presents a unified approach comprising three sections: General Overviews; Mechanisms and Modeling; and Materials and Devices. Discussions include sunlight capture, exciton diffusion and dissociation, interface properties, charge recombination and migration, and a variety of currently developing OPV materials/devices. The book also includes two forewords: one by Nobel Laureate Dr. Alan J. Heeger, and the other by Drs. Aloysius Hepp and Sheila Bailey of NASA Glenn Research Center. Organic Photovoltaics equips students, researchers, and engineers with knowledge of the mechanisms, materials, devices, and applications of OPVs necessary to develop cheaper, lighter, and cleaner renewable energy throughout the coming decades.},

Also firmly established is the d-wave symmetry of the superconducting state. The interplay of superconductivity and phase separation has been noted in previous mean-field studies of correlated electron models. To further explore this issue in a more rigorous approach we have conducted quantum Monte Carlo calculations of a two-dimensional Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor attractive interaction. For a vanishing on-site repulsion, the result agrees with that of Micnas, Ranninger, and Robaszkiewicz [Phys. Rev. B 39, 11 653 (1989)], and indicates that for a given strength of the attractive interaction, homogeneous d-wave superconducting phase can exist only above a critical doping concentration, below which phase separation occurs. A finite on-site repulsion modifies the phase separation behavior. A stronger d-wave pairing correlation is seen in the inhomogeneous phase compared to the homogeneous phase.},

The first three chapters contain introductory material culminating in a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation.The remaining four chapters describe a variety of more sophisticated approaches, which improve upon this approximation.Among the highlights of the seven chapters are (1) a review of the mathematics (mostly matrix algebra) required for the rest of the book, (2) an introduction to the basic techniques, ideas, and notations of quantum chemistry, (3) a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation, (4) a treatment of configuration interaction (Cl) and approaches incorporating electron correlation, (5) a description of the independent electron pair approximation and a variety of more sophisticated approaches that incorporate coupling between pairs, (6) a consideration of the perturbative approach to the calculation of the correlation energy of many-electron systems and (7) a brief introduction to the use of the one-particle many-body Green's function in quantum chemistry.Over 150 exercises, designed to help the reader acquire a working knowledge of the material, are embedded in the text. The book is largely self-contained and requires no prerequisite other than a solid undergraduate physical chemistry course; however, some exposure to quantum chemistry will enhance the student's appreciation of the material. Clear and well-written, this text is ideal for the second semester of a two-semester course in quantum chemistry, or for a special topics course.},

The main result is new expansions of the computational error, with computable leading-order term in a posteriori form, based on stochastic flows and discrete dual backward problems. The expansions lead to efficient and accurate computation of error estimates. Adaptive algorithms for either stochastic time steps or deterministic time steps are described. Numerical examples illustrate when stochastic and deterministic adaptive time steps are superior to constant time steps and when adaptive stochastic steps are superior to adaptive deterministic steps. Stochastic time steps use Brownian bridges and require more work for a given number of time steps. Deterministic time steps may yield more time steps but require less work; for example, in the limit of vanishing error tolerance, the ratio of the computational error and its computable estimate tends to 1 with negligible additional work to determine the adaptive deterministic time steps. \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Identification of pairing mechanisms leading to the unconventional superconductivity realized in copper-oxide, heavy-fermions, and organic compounds is one of the most challenging issues in condensed-matter physics. Clear evidence for an electron-phonon mechanism in conventional superconductors is seen by the isotope effect on the superconducting transition temperatures TSC, since isotopic substitution varies the phonon frequency without affecting the electronic states. In unconventional superconductors, magnetic fluctuations have been proposed to mediate superconductivity, and considerable efforts have been made to unravel relationships between normal-state magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity. Here, we show that characteristic experimental results on the ferromagnetic (FM) superconductor UCoGe (TCurie \textasciitilde{} 2.5 K and TSC \textasciitilde{} 0.6 K) can be understood consistently within a scenario of the spin-triplet superconductivity induced by FM spin fluctuations. Temperature and angle dependencies of the upper critical magnetic field of the superconductivity (Hc2) are calculated on the basis of the above scenario by solving the Eliashberg equation. Calculated Hc2 well agrees with the characteristic experimental results observed in UCoGe. This is a first example that FM fluctuations are shown to be a pairing glue of superconductivity.},

Compared with exact transient estimate results for systems with a small number of particles, we find that variance extrapolations provide accurate results for the true ground state together with stringent lower bounds. For larger systems these bounds can in turn be used to quantify the systematic bias of fixed-node calculations.

Interestingly, the underlying mechanism is shown to be an intrapocket nesting-associated long-range coupling rather than the previously believed ferromagnetic double-exchange effect. This challenges the validity of ferromagnetically compensated first-neighbor coupling reported from short-range fitting to the experimental dispersion, which turns out to result instead from the ferro-orbital order that is also found instrumental in stabilizing the magnetic order.},

The latter system also corresponds to the ground state of the Rokhsar-Kivelson quantum dimer model at its critical point. We find that, although spin-spin correlations decay exponentially in the RVB, four-spin valence-bond-solid correlations are critical, qualitatively like the well-known dimer-dimer correlations of the CDM, but decaying more slowly (as 1/r{$\alpha$} with {$\alpha\approx$}1.20, compared with {$\alpha$}=2 for the CDM). We also compute the distribution of monomer (defect) pair separations, which decay by a larger exponent in the RVB than in the CDM. We further study both models in their different winding-number sectors and evaluate the relative weights of different sectors. Like the CDM, all the observed RVB behaviors can be understood in the framework of a mapping to a ``height'' model characterized by a gradient-squared stiffness constant K. Four independent measurements consistently show a value KRVB{$\approx$}1.6KCDM, with the same kinds of numerical evaluations of KCDM giving results in agreement with the rigorously known value KCDM={$\pi$}/16. The background of a nonzero winding-number gradient W/L introduces spatial anisotropies and an increase in the effective K, both of which can be understood as a consequence of anharmonic terms in the height-model free energy, which are of relevance to the recently proposed scenario of ``Cantor deconfinement'' in extended quantum dimer models. In addition to the standard case of short bonds only, we also studied ensembles in which fourth-neighbor (bipartite) bonds are allowed at a density controlled by a tunable fugacity, resulting (as expected) in a smooth reduction of K.},

  abstract = {Building on previous work, we calculate the temperature- and frequency-dependent anomalous Hall conductivity for the putative multiband chiral superconductor Sr2RuO4 using a simple microscopic two-orbital model without impurities. A Hall effect arises in this system without the application of an external magnetic field due to the time-reversal-symmetry breaking chiral superconducting state. The anomalous Hall conductivity is nonzero only when there is more than one superconducting order parameter, involving inter- as well as intra-band Cooper pairing. We find that such a multiband superconducting state gives rise to a distinctive resonance in the frequency-dependence of the Hall conductivity at a frequency close to the inter-orbital hopping energy scale that describes hopping between Ru dxz and dyz orbitals. The detection of this feature, robust to temperature and impurity effects in the superconducting phase, would thus constitute compelling evidence in favour of a multiband origin of superconductivity in Sr2RuO4, with strong superconductivity on the {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} bands. The temperature dependence of the Hall conductivity and Kerr rotation angle are studied within this model at the one-loop approximation.},

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements have uncovered an important contribution of lattice vibrations (phonons) to superconductivity, sparking a fierce debate on the nature of the 'glue'\textemdash phonons or magnetic excitations\textemdash binding together the superconducting Cooper pairs. However, it is difficult to distinguish these two pairing forces owing to their similar energy scales. Here, we propose a fresh approach to investigate the origin of many-body interactions in these superconductors: an impurity-substitution effect on the low-energy dynamics, which is a magnetic analogue of the isotope effect used for classical superconductors. Our ARPES results reveal that the impurity-induced changes in the electron self-energy show a good correspondence to those of magnetic excitations, indicating the importance of spin fluctuations to electron pairing in the high-Tc superconductors.},

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

In practice, however, uncontrolled errors such as those arising from the fixed-node and pseudopotential approximations often limit the quality of results. We show that the accuracy of quantum Monte Carlo calculations is limited by using available pseudopotentials. In particular, it is necessary to include angular momentum channels in the pseudopotential for excited angular momentum states and to choose the local channel appropriately to obtain accurate results. Variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations for Zn, O, and Si atoms and ions demonstrate that these issues can affect total energies by up to several eV for common pseudopotentials. Adding higher-angular momentum channels into the pseudopotential description reduces such errors drastically without a significant increase in computational cost.},

We show that band-structure unfolding can be understood as projection onto induced irreducible representations of a group obtained by extending the original group of translations with a number of additional symmetry operations. The resulting framework allows us to define a generalized unfolding procedure that includes the point group operations and can be applied to any quantity in the reciprocal space. The unfolding of the Brillouin zone follows naturally from the properties of the induced irreducible representations. In this context, we also introduce a procedure to derive tight-binding models of reduced dimensionality by making use of point group symmetries. Further, we show that careful consideration of unfolding has important consequences on the interpretation of angle-resolved photoemission experiments. Finally, we apply the unfolding procedure to various representative examples of Fe-based superconductor compounds and show that the one-iron picture arises as an irreducible representation of the glide-reflection group, and we comment on the consequences for the interpretation of one-iron versus two-iron Brillouin zone representations.},

We also review in detail the more sophisticated DMC algorithm within the fixed-node approximation, introduced to avoid the infamous Fermionic sign problem, which allows one to sample a more accurate approximation to the ground-state wave function. Throughout this review, we discuss the statistical methods used for evaluating expectation values and statistical uncertainties. In particular, we show how to estimate nonlinear functions of expectation values and their statistical uncertainties.},

  abstract = {We pursue the development and application of the recently introduced linear optimization method for determining the optimal linear and nonlinear parameters of Jastrow\textendash Slater wave functions in a variational Monte Carlo framework. In this approach, the optimal parameters are found iteratively by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and its first-order derivatives, making use of a strong zero-variance principle. We extend the method to optimize the exponents of the basis functions, simultaneously with all the other parameters, namely, the Jastrow, configuration state function, and orbital parameters. We show that the linear optimization method can be thought of as a so-called augmented Hessian approach, which helps explain the robustness of the method and permits us to extend it to minimize a linear combination of the energy and the energy variance. We apply the linear optimization method to obtain the complete ground-state potential energy curve of the C 2 molecule up to the dissociation limit and discuss size consistency and broken spin-symmetry issues in quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We perform calculations for the first-row atoms and homonuclear diatomic molecules with fully optimized Jastrow\textendash Slater wave functions, and we demonstrate that molecular well depths can be obtained with near chemical accuracy quite systematically at the diffusion Monte Carlo level for these systems.},

The calculation of I(u) is made vastly more efficient by replacing the average of the local delta-function operator by the average of a smooth nonlocal operator that has several orders of magnitude smaller variance. These new estimators also reduce the systematic error (or bias) of the intracule density due to the approximate trial wave function. Used in combination with the optimization of an increasing number of parameters in trial Jastrow-Slater wave functions, they allow one to obtain well converged correlated intracule densities for atoms and molecules. These ideas can be applied to calculating any pair-correlation function in classical or quantum Monte Carlo calculations.},

Almost all previous implementations employ samples distributed as the physical probability density of the trial wave function, and assume the central limit theorem to be valid. In this paper we provide an analysis of random error in estimation and optimization that leads naturally to new sampling strategies with improved computational and statistical properties. A rigorous lower limit to the random error is derived, and an efficient sampling strategy presented that significantly increases computational efficiency. In addition the infinite variance heavy tailed random errors of optimum parameters in conventional methods are replaced with a Normal random error, strengthening the theoretical basis of optimization. The method is applied to a number of first row systems and compared with previously published results.},

Although multi-state approaches are of course preferred near conical intersections, other features of excited-state potential energy surfaces can benefit significantly from our single state approach. In three different systems, including a double bond dissociation, a biologically relevant amino hydrogen dissociation, and an amino-to-ring intramolecular charge transfer, we show that state-specific orbitals offer qualitative improvements over the state-averaged status quo.},

Temperature-dependent features indicating transitions (or crossovers) are correlated among the various experimental quantities. Taking into account recent spectroscopic studies, we argue that the most likely interpretation of the complete collection of results is that an unusual form of two-dimensional superconducting correlations appears together with the onset of spin-stripe order. Recent theoretical proposals for a sinusoidally modulated superconducting state compatible with stripe order provide an intriguing explanation of our results and motivate further experimental tests. We also discuss evidence for one-dimensional pairing correlations that appear together with the charge order. With regard to the overall phenomenology, we consider the degree to which similar behavior may have been observed in other cuprates and describe possible connections to various puzzling phenomena in cuprate superconductors.},

  abstract = {In the copper oxide parent compounds of the high-transition-temperature superconductors the valence electrons are localized\textemdash one per copper site\textemdash by strong intra-atomic Coulomb repulsion. A symptom of this localization is antiferromagnetism, where the spins of localized electrons alternate between up and down. Superconductivity appears when mobile 'holes' are doped into this insulating state, and it coexists with antiferromagnetic fluctuations. In one approach to describing the coexistence, the holes are believed to self-organize into 'stripes' that alternate with antiferromagnetic (insulating) regions within copper oxide planes, which would necessitate an unconventional mechanism of superconductivity. There is an apparent problem with this picture, however: measurements of magnetic excitations in superconducting YBa2Cu3O6+x near optimum doping are incompatible with the naive expectations for a material with stripes. Here we report neutron scattering measurements on stripe-ordered La1.875Ba0.125CuO4. We show that the measured excitations are, surprisingly, quite similar to those in YBa2Cu3O6+x (refs 9, 10) (that is, the predicted spectrum of magnetic excitations is wrong). We find instead that the observed spectrum can be understood within a stripe model by taking account of quantum excitations. Our results support the concept that stripe correlations are essential to high-transition-temperature superconductivity.},

  abstract = {One of the major themes in correlated electron physics over the last quarter century has been the problem of high-temperature superconductivity in hole-doped copper-oxide compounds. Fundamental to this problem is the competition between antiferromagnetic spin correlations, a symptom of strong Coulomb interactions, and the kinetic energy of the doped carriers, which favors delocalization. After discussing some of the early challenges in the field, I describe the experimental picture provided by a variety of spectroscopic and transport techniques. Then I turn to the technique of neutron scattering, and discuss how it is used to determine spin correlations, especially in model systems of quantum magnetism. Neutron scattering and complementary techniques have determined the extent to which antiferromagnetic spin correlations survive in the cuprate superconductors. One experimental case involves the ordering of spin and charge stripes. I first consider related measurements on model compounds, such as La 2-x Sr x NiO 4+{$\delta$} , and then discuss the case of La 2-x Ba x CuO 4 . In the latter system, recent transport studies have demonstrated that quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity coexists with the stripe order, but with frustrated phase order between the layers. This has led to new concepts for the coexistence of spin order and superconductivity. While the relevance of stripe correlations to high-temperature superconductivity remains a subject of controversy, there is no question that stripes are an intriguing example of electron matter that results from strong correlations.},

Despite the very different physics involved, in each case the rate factorizes into the particle-level matrix element squared, and an integral over a target material- and channel-specific dynamic structure factor. We show how the dynamic structure factor can be derived in all three cases following the same procedure, and extend previous results in the literature in several aspects. For electron transitions, we incorporate directional dependence and point out potential daily modulation signals in anisotropic target materials. For single phonon excitations, we present a new derivation of the rate formula from first principles for generic spin-independent couplings, and include the first calculation of phonon excitation through electron couplings. We also discuss the interplay between single phonon excitations and nuclear recoils, and clarify the role of Umklapp processes, which can dominate the single phonon production rate for dark matter heavier than an MeV. Our results highlight the complementarity between various search channels in probing different kinematic regimes of dark matter scattering, and provide a common reference to connect dark matter theories with ongoing and future direct detection experiments.},

A polynomial time solution to the sign problem is highly desired since it would provide an unbiased and numerically exact method to simulate correlated quantum systems. Here we show that such a solution is almost certainly unattainable by proving that the sign problem is nondeterministic polynomial (NP) hard, implying that a generic solution of the sign problem would also solve all problems in the complexity class NP in polynomial time.},

Electron number conservation is broken and correct only on average but both spin and spatial symmetries are preserved. Optimized natural orbitals and occupations are determined by diagonalization of a mean-field Hamiltonian. This constrained-pairing mean-field theory (CPMFT) yields a two-particle density matrix ansatz that exclusively describe strong correlations. We demonstrate CPMFT accuracy with applications to the metal-insulator transition of large hydrogen clusters and molecular dissociation curves.},

The recent development of phase-sensitive tests, combined with the refinement of several other symmetry-sensitive techniques, has for the most part settled this controversy in favor of predominantly d-wave symmetry for a number of optimally hole- and electron-doped cuprates. This paper begins by reviewing the concepts of the order parameter, symmetry breaking, and symmetry classification in the context of the cuprates. After a brief survey of some of the key non-phase-sensitive tests of pairing symmetry, the authors extensively review the phase-sensitive methods, which use the half-integer flux-quantum effect as an unambiguous signature for d-wave pairing symmetry. A number of related symmetry-sensitive experiments are described. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications, both fundamental and applied, of the predominantly d-wave pairing symmetry in the cuprates.},

We include all relevant physical corrections so that a direct comparison to experiment can be made. Around 50 GPa we find a maximum compression of 4.85. This compression is approximately 5.5\% higher than previous theoretical predictions and 15\% higher than the most accurate experimental data.

After several-years' struggle, we could succeed for the first time in growing high-quality single crystals of R 2-x\_\{2-\textbackslash mathrm\{\{x\}\}\} Sr x\_\{x\} NiO 4\_\{4\} with x exceeding 1.0. In this chapter, we investigate the detailed electronic structure and charge dynamics near the insulator-metal transition of the layered nickelates. We focus especially on the momentum-dependent pseudogap structure first observed in the barely metallic layered nickelates. It is now widely accepted that understanding the characteristic energy structures including the pseudogap is essential for clarifying the whole picture and possible origin of high-temperature superconductivity. We study the link between the spectroscopically-resolved pseudogap and the charge transport properties in the barely metallic layered nickelates. The orbital-resolved Fermi-surface structure and its doping variation are also investigated.},

The nature of the sign problem is discussed for various versions of PMC methods. A prescription for an exact PMC method in real space, i.e., a method that does not make a fixed-node or similar approximation and does not have a finite basis error, is presented. This method is likely to be practical for systems with a small number of electrons.

On the base of ab initio band structure calculations and an analysis of various contributions to exchange interactions between Cr spins, we explain this tendency as originating from a competition between antiferromagnetic direct nearest-neighbor d-d exchange and ferromagnetic superexchange via Sulfur p states, which leads to a change of sign of the nearest-neighbor interaction, depending on the radius of an M ion. It is shown that other important interactions are the third-neighbor interaction in a layer and interlayer exchange. We suggest that strong magnetoelastic coupling is probably responsible for the multiferroic properties of at least one material in this family, namely, AgCrS2.},

  abstract = {Enhancement of the production of cold molecules via photoassociation is considered for the Cs2 system. The employment of chirped picosecond pulses is proposed and studied theoretically. The analysis is based on the ability to achieve impulsive excitation which is given by the ultracold initial conditions where the nuclei are effectively stationary during the interaction with a field. The appropriate theoretical framework is the coordinate-dependent two-level system. Matching the pulse parameters to the potentials and initial conditions results in full Rabi cycling between the electronic potentials. By chirping the laser pulse, adiabatic transfer leading to the population inversion from the ground to the excited state is possible in a broad and tunable range of internuclear distance. Numerical simulations based on solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) were performed. The simulation of the photoassociation of Cs2 from the ground 3{$\Sigma$}+u to the excited 0-g state under ultracold conditions verifies the qualitative picture. The ability to control the population transfer is employed to optimize molecular formation. Transfer of population to the excited 0-g surface leaves a void in the nuclear density of the ground 3{$\Sigma$}+u surface. This void is either filled by thermal motion or by quantum ``pressure'' and it is the rate-determining step in the photoassociation. The spontaneous-emission process leading to cold-molecules is simulated by including an optical potential in the TDSE. Consequently, the rate of cold molecule formation in a pulsed mode is found to be larger than that obtained in a continuous-wave mode.},

In contrast to the CASSCF photoisomerization mechanism of bond inversion followed by torsion around formal double bonds, we find that the other approaches predict an initial skeletal relaxation which does not lead to bond inversion but to a rather flexible retinal chromophore with longer bonds and with the bond-length pattern of the ground state being partly preserved. The relaxation proceeds then preferentially via partial torsion around formal single bonds and does not reach a conical intersection region. Our findings are compatible with solution experiments which point to the existence of multiple minima and relaxation pathways, some of which are nonreactive, do not lead to photoproducts via conical intersection, and are dominant in solution. Our results also demonstrate the importance of a balanced description of dynamical and static correlation in the excited-state gradients and raise serious concerns on the common use of the CASSCF method to investigate structural properties of photoexcited retinal systems.},

ReaxFF uses a general relationship between bond distance and bond order on one hand and between bond order and bond energy on the other hand that leads to proper dissociation of bonds to separated atoms. Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as Rij \textrightarrow{} 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons. The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster. In turn, the PM3 is about 100 times faster than the QC calculations. Thus, with ReaxFF we hope to be able to study complex reactions in hydrocarbons.},

  abstract = {A model of copper-oxygen bonding and antibonding bands with the most general two-body interactions allowable by symmetry is considered. The model has a continuous transition as a function of hole density x and temperature T to a phase in which a current circulates in each unit cell. This phase preserves the translational symmetry of the lattice while breaking time-reversal invariance and fourfold rotational symmetry. The product of time reversal and fourfold rotation is preserved. The circulating current phase terminates at a critical point at x=xc, T=0. In the quantum critical region about this point the logarithm of the frequency of the current fluctuations scales with their momentum. The microscopic basis for the marginal Fermi-liquid phenemenology and the observed long-wavelength transport anomalies near x=xc are derived from such fluctuations. The symmetry of the current fluctuations is such that the associated magnetic field fluctuations are absent at oxygen sites and have the correct form to explain the anomalous copper nuclear relaxation rate. Crossovers to the Fermi-liquid phase on either side of xc and the role of disorder are briefly considered. The current fluctuations promote superconductive instability with a propensity towards ``D-wave'' symmetry or ``extended S-wave''symmetry depending on details of the band structure. Several experiments are proposed to test the theory.},

  abstract = {Our ability to understand and simulate the reactions catalyzed by iron depends strongly on our ability to predict the relative energetics of spin states. In this work, we studied the electronic structures of Fe2+ ion, gaseous FeO and 14 iron complexes using Kohn\textendash Sham density functional theory with particular focus on determining the ground spin state of these species as well as the magnitudes of relevant spin-state energy splittings. The 14 iron complexes investigated in this work have hexacoordinate geometries of which seven are Fe(II), five are Fe(III) and two are Fe(IV) complexes. These are calculated using 20 exchange\textendash correlation functionals. In particular, we use a local spin density approximation (LSDA) \textendash{} GVWN5, four generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) \textendash{} BLYP, PBE, OPBE and OLYP, two non-separable gradient approximations (NGAs) \textendash{} GAM and N12, two meta-GGAs \textendash{} M06-L and M11-L, a meta-NGA \textendash{} MN15-L, five hybrid GGAs \textendash{} B3LYP, B3LYP*, PBE0, B97-3 and SOGGA11-X, four hybrid meta-GGAs \textendash{} M06, PW6B95, MPW1B95 and M08-SO and a hybrid meta-NGA \textendash{} MN15. The density functional results are compared to reference data, which include experimental results as well as the results of diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations and ligand field theory estimates from the literature. For the Fe2+ ion, all functionals except M11-L correctly predict the ground spin state to be quintet. However, quantitatively, most of the functionals are not close to the experimentally determined spin-state splitting energies. For FeO all functionals predict quintet to be the ground spin state. For the 14 iron complexes, the hybrid functionals B3LYP, MPW1B95 and MN15 correctly predict the ground spin state of 13 out of 14 complexes and PW6B95 gets all the 14 complexes right. The local functionals, OPBE, OLYP and M06-L, predict the correct ground spin state for 12 out of 14 complexes. Two of the tested functionals are not recommended to be used for this type of study, in particular M08-SO and M11-L, because M08-SO systematically overstabilizes the high spin state, and M11-L systematically overstabilizes the low spin state.},

Most of these spectra were measured at the Russian-German beamline at BESSY II, while the spectra of KF and CuF2 were taken under comparable experimental conditions at the D1011 beamline at MAX-lab. The spectra of the solid samples were recorded via the total electron yield. The NEXAFS spectra were taken with the aim to elucidate the role of covalent bonding and its manifestation in x-ray absorption spectra as well as to gain information on the electronic structure of the conduction band along the whole series of 3d transition-metal (TM) fluorides. The spectra of these most ionic compounds of the 3d TM's have been analyzed in a comparative way considering also the F1s NEXAFS spectrum of the molecular TiF2-6 anion in solid K2TiF6. In its turn, the latter spectrum has been interpreted by comparing with the F1s NEXAFS spectrum of the molecular PF-6 anion in KPF6 and that of SF6 in the gas phase. In this way, the low-lying empty electronic states of the 3d TM fluorides are shown to be formed by covalent mixing of the TM 3d with the fluorine 2p electronic states. It is further found that the number of low-lying empty electronic states with TM 3d-fluorine 2p hybridized character decreases gradually along the series of 3d TM fluorides, and is essentially zero in the case of ZnF2.},

  abstract = {We address the calculation of dynamical correlation functions for many fermion systems at zero temperature, using the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. The two-dimensional Hubbard hamiltonian is used as a model system. Although most of the calculations performed here are for cases where the sign problem is absent, the discussions are kept general for applications to physical problems when the sign problem does arise. We study the use of twisted boundary conditions to improve the extrapolation of the results to the thermodynamic limit. A strategy is proposed to drastically reduce finite size effects relying on a minimization among the twist angles. This approach is demonstrated by computing the charge gap at half filling. We obtain accurate results showing the scaling of the gap with the interaction strength U in two dimensions, connecting to the scaling of the unrestricted Hartree-Fock method at small U and Bethe ansatz exact result in one dimension at large U. An alternative algorithm is then proposed to compute dynamical Green functions and correlation functions which explicitly varies the number of particles during the random walks in the manifold of Slater determinants. In dilute systems, such as ultracold Fermi gases, this algorithm enables calculations with much more favorable complexity, with computational cost proportional to basis size or the number of lattice sites.},

  abstract = {Magnesium hydride is cheap and contains 7.7 wt \% hydrogen, making it one of the most attractive hydrogen storage materials. However, thermodynamics dictate that hydrogen desorption from bulk magnesium hydride only takes place at or above 300 \textdegree C, which is a major impediment for practical application. A few results in the literature, related to disordered materials and very thin layers, indicate that lower desorption temperatures are possible. We systematically investigated the effect of crystal grain size on the thermodynamic stability of magnesium and magnesium hydride, using ab initio Hartree-Fock and density functional theory calculations. Also, the stepwise desorption of hydrogen was followed in detail. As expected, both magnesium and magnesium hydride become less stable with decreasing cluster size, notably for clusters smaller than 20 magnesium atoms. However, magnesium hydride destabilizes more strongly than magnesium. As a result, the hydrogen desorption energy decreases significantly when the crystal grain size becomes smaller than {$\sim$}1.3 nm. For instance, an MgH2 crystallite size of 0.9 nm corresponds to a desorption temperature of only 200 \textdegree C. This predicted decrease of the hydrogen desorption temperature is an important step toward the application of Mg as a hydrogen storage material.},

By using time-of-flight neutron instrumentation coupled with single crystal sample rotation we obtain a four-dimensional data set (three \{\textbackslash bf Q\} and one energy) that is both comprehensive and spans a large region of reciprocal space. Our measurements identify rich structure in the energy dependence of the highly dispersive spin excitations, which are centered at equivalent (\$\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\},\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}, L\$) wave-vectors. These structures correlate strongly with several crossings of the spin excitations with the lightly dispersive phonons found in this system. These effects are significant and account for on the order of 25\$\textbackslash\%\$ of the total inelastic scattering for energies between \$\textbackslash sim\$5 and 40 meV at low \$|\{\textbackslash bf Q\}|\$. Interestingly, this scattering also presents little or no \$L\$-dependence. As the phonons and dispersive spin excitations centered at equivalent (\$\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\},\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{2\}, L\$) wave-vectors are common to all members of La-based 214 copper oxides, we conclude such strong quasi-two dimensional scattering enhancements are likely to occur in all such 214 families of materials, including those concentrations corresponding to superconducting ground states. Such a phenomenon appears to be a fundamental characteristic of these materials and is potentially related to superconducting pairing.},

The optical results, which are the first quantitative calculations performed for realistic parameters of the three-band Hubbard model, clearly show three allowed optical transitions: (i) itinerant motion of the Cu-O singlets, having (for doping concentrations x{$\neq$}0) a spectral Drude distribution around {$\omega$}=0 with spectral weight proportional to x; (ii) unbinding of the O hole from the Cu spin in the singlet.

Ultracold molecules offer capabilities that are otherwise difficult or impossible to achieve in other effective spin systems, such as long-ranged spin-spin interactions with controllable degrees of spatial and spin anisotropy and favorable energy scales. Realizing quantum magnetism with ultracold molecules provides access to rich many-body behaviors, including many exotic phases of matter and interesting excitations and dynamics. Far-from-equilibrium dynamics plays a key role in our exposition, just as it did in recent ultracold molecule experiments realizing effective quantum magnetism. In particular, we show that dynamical probes allow the observation of correlated many-body spin physics, even in polar molecule gases that are not quantum degenerate. After describing how quantum magnetism arises in ultracold molecules and discussing recent observations of quantum magnetism with polar molecules, we survey prospects for the future, ranging from immediate goals to long-term visions.},

These theories could be tested by inelastic neutron scattering (INS), as a change in the magnetic scattering intensity that marks the entry into the superconducting state provides a precise quantitative measure of the spin-interaction energy involved in the superconductivity. However, the absolute intensities of spin fluctuations measured in neutron scattering experiments vary widely, and are usually much smaller than expected from fundamental sum rules, resulting in `missing' INS intensity. Here, we solve this problem by studying magnetic excitations in the one-dimensional related compound, Sr2CuO3, for which an exact theory of the dynamical spin response has recently been developed. In this case, the missing INS intensity can be unambiguously identified and associated with the strongly covalent nature of magnetic orbitals. We find that whereas the energies of spin excitations in Sr2CuO3 are well described by the nearest-neighbour spin-1/2 Heisenberg Hamiltonian, the corresponding magnetic INS intensities are modified markedly by the strong 2p\textendash 3d hybridization of Cu and O states. Hence, the ionic picture of magnetism, where spins reside on the atomic-like 3d orbitals of Cu2+ ions, fails markedly in the cuprates.},

In contrast to the susceptibility behavior observed in polycrystalline samples, no Curie-Weiss behavior is observed, and a linear-T dependent susceptibility occurs from the spin-density-wave transition temperature, (Ts), to 700 K. This result suggests that strong antiferromagnetic correlations are present well above Ts. A twofold symmetry of susceptibility in the ab plane indicates a stripelike spin structure as observed by neutron scattering. The resistivity minimum is strongly dependent on the magnetic field, suggesting that the upturn of the resistivity at low temperatures should be related to spin fluctuation.},

  abstract = {Properties of an InSe monolayer under external vertical electric fields.           ,              External electric fields can be used to manipulate the electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials. 2D InSe semiconductors possess high electron mobility and wide band gap tunability. Therefore, they have been proposed for use in ultrathin electronic devices. Here, using first-principles calculations, we study the charge polarization, structure, electronic structure, and gas adsorption of an InSe monolayer under vertical electric fields. We find that both the structural evolution and charge polarization rely on the directions of the electric fields. The hole effective mass at the valance band maximum can be decreased by fields that offer a possible route to increase mobility. In contrast, the fields have little impact on the effective mass of electrons at the conduction band minimum. Therefore, high electron mobility in InSe is retained under the fields. Besides, electric fields could alter the absorption intensity for gas molecules. Therefore, gas sensors could be an expected application. More importantly, this work systematically points out some key steps for setting up electric-field calculations in the popular VASP code, such as the cancellation of the symmetrisation of the charge density, avoiding electrons spilling out into the vacuum under high fields.},

It is known that AlH3 exists in multiply forms of polymorphs, where {$\alpha$}-AlH3 is found to be the most stable with a hexagonal structure. Recent experimental studies on {$\gamma$}-AlH3 reported an orthorhombic structure with a unique double-bridge bond between certain Al and H atoms. This was not found in {$\alpha$}-AlH3 or other polymorphs. Using density functional theory, we have investigated the energetics, and the structural, electronic, and phonon vibrational properties for the newly reported {$\gamma$}-AlH3 structure. The current calculation concludes that {$\gamma$}-AlH3 is less stable than {$\alpha$}-AlH3 by 1.2 KJ/mol, with the zero-point energy included. Interesting binding features associated with the unique geometry of {$\gamma$}-AlH3 are discussed from the calculated electronic properties and phonon vibrational modes. The binding of H-s with higher energy Al-p,d orbitals is enhanced within the double-bridge arrangement, giving rise to a higher electronic energy for the system. Distinguishable new features in the vibrational spectrum of {$\gamma$}-AlH3 were attributed to the double-bridge and hexagonal-ring structures.},

  abstract = {In recent years, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered great interest as topological materials. In particular, monolayers of centrosymmetric {$\beta$}-phase TMDs have been identified as 2D topological insulators (TIs), and bulk crystals of noncentrosymmetric {$\gamma$}-phase MoTe2 and WTe2 have been identified as type-II Weyl semimetals. However, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and STM probes of these semimetals have revealed huge, arclike surface states that overwhelm, and are sometimes mistaken for, the much smaller topological surface Fermi arcs of bulk type-II Weyl points. In this Letter, we calculate the bulk and surface electronic structure of both {$\beta$}- and {$\gamma$}-MoTe2. We find that {$\beta$}-MoTe2 is, in fact, a Z4-nontrivial higher-order TI (HOTI) driven by double band inversion and exhibits the same surface features as {$\gamma$}-MoTe2 and {$\gamma$}-WTe2. We discover that these surface states are not topologically trivial, as previously characterized by the research that differentiated them from the Weyl Fermi arcs but, rather, are the characteristic split and gapped fourfold Dirac surface states of a HOTI. In {$\beta$}-MoTe2, this indicates that it would exhibit helical pairs of hinge states if it were bulk insulating, and in {$\gamma$}-MoTe2 and {$\gamma$}-WTe2, these surface states represent vestiges of HOTI phases without inversion symmetry that are nearby in parameter space. Using nested Wilson loops and first-principles calculations, we explicitly demonstrate that, when the Weyl points in {$\gamma$}-MoTe2 are annihilated, which may be accomplished by symmetry-preserving strain or lattice distortion, {$\gamma$}-MoTe2 becomes a nonsymmetry-indicated, noncentrosymmetric HOTI. We also show that, when the effects of spin-orbit coupling are neglected, {$\beta$}-MoTe2 is a nodal-line semimetal with Z2-nontrivial monopole nodal lines (MNLSM). This finding confirms that MNLSMs driven by double band inversion are the weak-spin-orbit coupling limit of HOTIs, implying that MNLSMs are higher-order topological semimetals with flat-band-like hinge states, which we find to originate from the corner modes of 2D ``fragile'' TIs.},

However, the absence of strong low-frequency magnetic fluctuations near or above the transition has been interpreted as implying the primacy of orbital ordering. In contrast, we establish that quantum fluctuations of spin-1 local moments with strongly frustrated exchange interactions can lead to a nematic quantum paramagnetic phase consistent with the observations in FeSe. We show that this phase is a fundamental expression of the existence of a Berry's phase associated with the topological defects of a N\'eel antiferromagnet, in a manner analogous to that which gives rise to valence bond crystal order for spin-1/2 systems. We present an exactly solvable model realizing the nematic quantum paramagnetic phase, discuss its relation with the spin-1 J1\textendash J2 model, and construct a field theory of the Landau-forbidden transition between the N\'eel state and this nematic quantum paramagnet.},

Two substantial contributions to the error in GGA oxidation energies are identified. The first contribution originates from the overbinding of GGA in the O2 molecule and only occurs when the oxidant is O2. The second error occurs in all oxidation reactions and is related to the correlation error in 3d orbitals in GGA. Strong self-interaction in GGA systematically penalizes a reduced state (with more d electrons) over an oxidized state, resulting in an overestimation of oxidation energies. The constant error in the oxidation energy from the O2 binding error can be corrected by fitting the formation enthalpy of simple nontransition metal oxides. Removal of the O2 binding error makes it possible to address the correlation effects in 3d transition metal oxides with the GGA+U method. Calculated oxidation energies agree well with experimental data for reasonable and consistent values of U.},

Doping influences both the real-space patterns and long timescales of these excitations with a clear carrier asymmetry attributable to particle-hole symmetry breaking in the underlying model. Further, a rapidly oscillating charge-density-wave-like pattern weakens, but persists as a visible demonstration of a subleading instability at half-filling which remains upon doping.

The low-temperature Fermi surface is that of a compensated metal consisting of one hole and two electron bands and is fully determined by combining the knowledge from ARPES and quantum oscillations. A manifestation of the nematic state is the significant increase in the nematic susceptibility approaching the structural transition that we detect from our elastoresistance measurements on FeSe. The dramatic changes in electronic structure cannot be explained by the small lattice distortion and, in the absence of magnetic fluctuations above the structural transition, point clearly towards an electronically driven transition in FeSe, stabilized by orbital-charge ordering.},

Here, we use a recently developed first-principles method to study the electron-doped cuprates and elucidate the deep physical reasons behind their behaviour being so different from that of the hole-doped materials. The crystal structure of the electron-doped compounds is characterized by a lack of apical oxygens, and we find that it results in a parent compound that is a Slater insulator\textemdash a material in which the insulating behaviour is the result of the presence of magnetic long-range order. This is in sharp contrast with the hole-doped materials, which are insulating owing to the strong electronic correlations but not owing to magnetism.},

Such quantum state preparation can be used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the circuit to minimize the energy of the constructed quantum state for a given problem Hamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a simple-to-implement class of quantum states motivated by adiabatic state preparation. We test its accuracy and determine the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with up to 12 sites (24 spin orbitals), and for small molecules. We find that this ansatz converges faster than previously proposed schemes based on unitary coupled clusters. While the required number of measurements is astronomically large for quantum chemistry applications to molecules, applying the variational approach to the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to be far less demanding and potentially practical on small quantum computers. We also discuss another application of quantum state preparation using short quantum circuits, to prepare trial ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state preparation.},

Two tools are inevitable for this purpose: (i) quantum chemical methods that are able to treat a given cluster with both sufficient accuracy and efficiency and (ii) algorithms that are able to systematically scan the (3n-6)-dimensional potential surface of an n-atomic cluster for promising isomers. Currently, the only quantum chemical method that can be applied to metal clusters is density functional theory (DFT). Other methods either do not account for the multi-reference character of metal clusters or are too expensive and thus can be applied only to clusters of very few atoms, which usually is not sufficient for studying the building principles. The accuracy of DFT is not known a priori, but extrapolations to bulk values from calculated series of data show satisfying agreement with experimental data. For scans of the potential surface, simulated annealing techniques or genetic algorithms were used for the smaller clusters (approx. 20\textendash 30 atoms), and for the larger clusters considerations were restricted to selected packings and shapes. For the mixed-metallic clusters, perturbation theory turned out to be efficient and successful for finding the most promising distributions of the two atom types at the different sites.},

We demonstrate that dynamical screening effects are important not only for higher-energy spectral features, such as correlation satellites seen in photoemission spectroscopy, but also for the low-energy electronic structure. Our analysis indicates that BaFe2As2 is a strongly correlated compound with strongly doping- and temperature-dependent properties. In the hole-overdoped regime an incoherent metal is found, whereas Fermi-liquid behaviour is recovered in the undoped compound. At optimal doping, the self-energy exhibits an unusual square-root energy dependence, which leads to strong band renormalizations near the Fermi level.},

  abstract = {The quantum mechanical position operators, and their products, are not well-defined in systems obeying periodic boundary conditions. Here we extend the work of Resta [Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 1800 (1998)], who developed a formalism to calculate the electronic polarization as an expectation value of a many-body operator, to include higher multipole moments, e.g., quadrupole and octupole. We define nth-order multipole operators whose expectation values can be used to calculate the nth multipole moment when all of the lower moments are vanishing (modulo a quantum). We show that changes in our operators are tied to flows of n-1st multipole currents, and encode the adiabatic evolution of the system in the presence of an n-1st gradient of the electric field. Finally, we test our operators on a set of tight-binding models to show that they correctly determine the phase diagrams of topological quadrupole and octupole models, capture an adiabatic quadrupole pump, and distinguish a bulk quadrupole moment from other mechanisms that generate corner charges.},

They are orthogonal, infinitely smooth, symmetric, polynomially complete, and with a high degree of locality. Because they are formed from Gaussians, they are easily combined with traditional atom-centered Gaussian bases. We also introduce diagonal approximations that dramatically reduce the computational scaling of two-electron Coulomb terms in the Hamiltonian.},

The second section deals with the results of thermal expansion studies of these dichalcogenides. A thermodynamic discussion of the thermal expansion in uniaxial crystals is given. The thermal expansion of these compounds, except TiS2, is anomalous, the expansion in the plane perpendicular to the unique axis is larger than along the unique axis. This anomalous behaviour is ascribed to the strong repulsion between the 3d electrons. In section 3 the structures and physical properties of the intercalates of the 3d transition metal dichalcogenides are discussed. New results are given for nonstoichiometric chromium intercalates. These compounds show semiconducting behaviour and have localized magnetic moments. The localization of the d electrons in the alkali metal intercalates increases in the series Ti, V, Cr. Chromium compounds always show localized behaviour while the vanadium compounds occur in two forms with resp. localized behaviour for the stoichiometric compounds and delocalized behaviour for the alkali-metal poor compounds.},

Density functional theory (DFT) simulations are the theoretical methods of choice to understand and design perovskite materials. However, tests on the reliability of DFT to describe fundamental properties of oxide perovskites are scarce and mostly ill-defined due to a lack of rigorous theoretical benchmarks for solids. Here, we present a quantum Monte Carlo benchmark study of DFT on the archetypal perovskite BaTiO\$\_\{3\}\$ (BTO). It shows that no DFT approximation can simultaneously reproduce the energy, structure, and electronic density of BTO. Traditional protocols to select DFT approximations are empirical and fail to detect this shortcoming. An approach combining two different non-empirical DFT schemes, "SCAN" and "HSE06", is able to holistically describe BTO with accuracy. Combined DFT approaches should thus be considered as a promising alternative to standard methods for simulating oxide perovskites.},

Selection of the two-particle excitations is done using the quantum Monte Carlo method within the presence of a Jastrow correlation factor and without the need to explicitly construct the determinants. We also show how this technique can be used to design compact wave functions for transition metal systems.

At centre stage is the pseudogap phase, which occupies a large portion of the cuprate phase diagram surrounding the superconducting dome. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we find that a static, non-dispersive, 'checkerboard'-like electronic modulation exists in a broad regime of the cuprate phase diagram and exhibits strong doping dependence. The continuous increase of checkerboard periodicity with hole density strongly suggests that the checkerboard originates from charge-density-wave formation in the antinodal region of the cuprate Fermi surface. These results reveal a coherent picture for static electronic orderings in the cuprates and shed important new light on the nature of the pseudogap phase.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the relative stabilities of alane (AlH3) complexes with electron donors is essential for identifying hydrogen storage materials for vehicular applications that can be regenerated by off-board methods; however, almost no thermodynamic data are available to make this assessment. To fill this gap, we employed the G4(MP2) method to determine heats of formation, entropies, and Gibbs free energies of formation for thirty-eight alane complexes with NH3-nRn (R = Me, Et; n = 0-3), pyridine, pyrazine, triethylenediamine (TEDA), quinuclidine, OH2-nRn (R = Me, Et; n = 0-2), dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Monomer, bis, and selected dimer complex geometries were considered. Using these data, we computed the thermodynamics of the key formation and dehydrogenation reactions that would occur during hydrogen delivery and alane regeneration, from which trends in complex stability were identified. These predictions were tested by synthesizing six amine-alane complexes involving trimethylamine, triethylamine, dimethylethylamine, TEDA, quinuclidine, and hexamine, and obtaining upper limits of delta G for their formation from metallic aluminum. Combining these computational and experimental results, we establish a criterion for complex stability relevant to hydrogen storage that can be used to assess potential ligands prior to attempting synthesis of the alane complex. Based on this, we conclude that only a subset of the tertiary amine complexes considered and none of the ether complexes can be successfully formed by direct reaction with aluminum and regenerated in an alane-based hydrogen storage system.},

  abstract = {We marry tensor network states (TNS) and projector quantum Monte Carlo (PMC) to overcome the high computational scaling of TNS and the sign problem of PMC. Using TNS as trial wave functions provides a route to systematically improve the sign structure and to eliminate the bias in fixed-node and constrained-path PMC. As a specific example, we describe phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo with matrix product states (MPS-AFQMC). MPS-AFQMC improves significantly on the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) ground-state energy. For the J1-J2 model on two-dimensional square lattices, we observe with MPS-AFQMC an order of magnitude reduction in the error for all couplings, compared to DMRG. The improvement is independent of walker bond dimension, and we therefore use bond dimension 1 for the walkers. The computational cost of MPS-AFQMC is then quadratic in the bond dimension of the trial wave function, which is lower than the cubic scaling of DMRG. The error due to the constrained-path bias is proportional to the variational error of the trial wave function. We show that for the J1-J2 model on two-dimensional square lattices, a linear extrapolation of the MPS-AFQMC energy with the discarded weight from the DMRG calculation allows us to remove the constrained-path bias. Extensions to other tensor networks are briefly discussed.},

In the absence of doping the two-magnon peak position is directly proportional to the superexchange strength J. We find that both x and y affect the peak position considerably. The N\'eel temperature determined from muon spin rotation on the same samples independently confirms the strong dependence of the magnetic interaction on x and y.

Furthermore, our QMC calculations show that the DFT error depends substantially on cluster size. These results suggest that in simulating metal-hydride systems it is very important to apply accurate methods that go beyond traditional mean-field approaches as a benchmark of their performance for a given material, and QMC is an appealing method to provide such a benchmark due to its high level of accuracy and favorable scaling (N3) with the number of electrons.},

The generator of these rotations are computed variationally and thus go beyond standard perturbative methods; the error is controlled by the locality of the variational ansatz. The method is demonstrated on two models. First, in the attractive Fermi-Hubbard model with on-site disorder, we find indications of a lack of observable many-body localization in the thermodynamic limit due to the inevitable mixture of different spinon sectors. Second, in the low-energy sector of the XY spin model with a broken U(1)-symmetry, we analyze ground state response functions by combining the variational SW transformation with the truncated spectrum approach.},

However, the character of magnetic interactions and spin fluctuations in ferropnictides is not reasonably described by conventional models of magnetism. Here we show that the most puzzling features can be naturally reconciled within a rather simple effective spin model with a biquadratic interaction, which is consistent with electronic structure calculations. By going beyond the Heisenberg model, our description explains numerous experimental observations, including the peculiarities of the spin-wave spectrum, thin domain walls and crossover from a first- to second-order phase transition under doping.

  abstract = {Ever since its discovery the notion of Berry phase has permeated through all branches of physics. Over the past three decades it was gradually realized that the Berry phase of the electronic wave function can have a profound effect on material properties and is responsible for a spectrum of phenomena, such as polarization, orbital magnetism, various (quantum, anomalous, or spin) Hall effects, and quantum charge pumping. This progress is summarized in a pedagogical manner in this review. A brief summary of necessary background is given and a detailed discussion of the Berry phase effect in a variety of solid-state applications. A common thread of the review is the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics, which is a versatile tool in the study of electron dynamics in the presence of electromagnetic fields and more general perturbations. Finally, a requantization method is demonstrated that converts a semiclassical theory to an effective quantum theory. It is clear that the Berry phase should be added as an essential ingredient to our understanding of basic material properties.},

  abstract = {We employ semilocal density functionals [local spin-density approximation (LSDA), Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and meta-GGAs)], LSDA plus Hubbard U (LSDA+U) theory, a nonlocal range-separated Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06), and the random-phase approximation (RPA) to assess their performances for the ground-state magnetism and electronic structure of a strongly correlated metal, rutile VO2. Using recent quantum Monte Carlo results as the benchmark, all tested semilocal and hybrid functionals as well as the RPA (with PBE inputs) predict the correct magnetic ground states for rutile VO2. The observed paramagnetism could arise from temperature-disordered local spin moments or from the thermal destruction of these moments. All semilocal functionals also give the correct ground-state metallicity for rutile VO2. However, in the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, LSDA+U and HSE06 incorrectly predict rutile VO2 to be a Mott-Hubbard insulator. For the computed electronic structures of FM and AFM phases, we find that the Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (TPSS) and revised TPSS (revTPSS) meta-GGAs give strong 2p-3d hybridizations, resulting in a depopulation of the 2p bands of O atoms, in comparison with other tested meta-GGAs. The regularized TPSS (regTPSS) and meta-GGAs made simple, i.e., MGGA\_MS0 and MGGA\_MS2, which are free of the spurious order-of-limits problem of TPSS and revTPSS, give electronic states close to those of the PBE GGA and LSDA. In comparison to experiment, semilocal functionals predict better equilibrium cell volumes for rutile VO2 in FM and AFM states than in the spin-unpolarized state. For meta-GGAs, a monotonic decrease of the exchange enhancement factor Fx(s,{$\alpha$}) with {$\alpha$} for small s, as in the MGGA\_MS functionals, leads to large (probably too large) local magnetic moments in spin-polarized states.},

  abstract = {Coupled-cluster (CC) methods have been extensively used as the high-level approach in quantum electronic structure theory to predict various properties of molecules when experimental results are unavailable. It is often assumed that CC methods, if they include at least up to connected-triple-excitation quasiperturbative corrections to a full treatment of single and double excitations (in particular, CCSD(T)), and a very large basis set, are more accurate than Kohn\textendash Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT). In the present work, we tested and compared the performance of standard CC and KS methods on bond energy calculations of 20 3d transition metal-containing diatomic molecules against the most reliable experimental data available, as collected in a database called 3dMLBE20. It is found that, although the CCSD(T) and higher levels CC methods have mean unsigned deviations from experiment that are smaller than most exchange-correlation functionals for metal\textendash ligand bond energies of transition metals, the improvement is less than one standard deviation of the mean unsigned deviation. Furthermore, on average, almost half of the 42 exchange-correlation functionals that we tested are closer to experiment than CCSD(T) with the same extended basis set for the same molecule. The results show that, when both relativistic and core\textendash valence correlation effects are considered, even the very high-level (expensive) CC method with single, double, triple, and perturbative quadruple cluster operators, namely, CCSDT(2)Q, averaged over 20 bond energies, gives a mean unsigned deviation (MUD(20) = 4.7 kcal/mol when one correlates only valence, 3p, and 3s electrons of transition metals and only valence electrons of ligands, or 4.6 kcal/mol when one correlates all core electrons except for 1s shells of transition metals, S, and Cl); and that is similar to some good xc functionals (e.g., B97-1 (MUD(20) = 4.5 kcal/mol) and PW6B95 (MUD(20) = 4.9 kcal/mol)) when the same basis set is used. We found that, for both coupled cluster calculations and KS calculations, the T1 diagnostics correlate the errors better than either the M diagnostics or the B1 DFT-based diagnostics. The potential use of practical standard CC methods as a benchmark theory is further confounded by the finding that CC and DFT methods usually have different signs of the error. We conclude that the available experimental data do not provide a justification for using conventional single-reference CC theory calculations to validate or test xc functionals for systems involving 3d transition metals.},

The electric current passing through a conducting antiferromagnet is polarized as well, leading to spin-transfer torques when the order parameter is textured, such as in antiferromagnetic noncollinear spin valves and domain walls. We report a first principles study on the electronic transport properties of antiferromagnetic systems. The current-induced spin torques acting on the magnetic moments are comparable with those in conventional ferromagnetic materials, leading to measurable angular resistances and current-induced magnetization dynamics. In contrast to ferromagnets, spin torques in antiferromagnets are very nonlocal. The torques acting far away from the center of an antiferromagnetic domain wall should facilitate current-induced domain wall motion.},

In underdoped copper oxides, there is strong evidence that an energy gap (the pseudogap) opens up at a temperature significantly higher than the critical temperature (by 100\textendash 220 K). Certain features of the pseudogap suggest that it is closely related to the gap that appears at the critical temperature (for example, the variation of the gap magnitudes around the Fermi surface and their maximum amplitudes are very similar). However, the Meissner effect is absent in the pseudogap state. The nature of the pseudogap state, and its relation (if any) to the superconducting state are central issues in understanding copper oxide superconductivity. Recent evidence suggests that, in the underdoped regime, the Meissner state is destroyed above the critical temperature by strong phase fluctuations (as opposed to a vanishing of the superfluid density). Here we report evidence for vortices (or vortex-like excitations) in La2-xSrxCuO4 at temperatures significantly above the critical temperature. A thermal gradient is applied to the sample in a magnetic field. Vortices are detected by the large transverse electric field produced as they diffuse down the gradient (the Nernst effect). We find that the Nernst signal is anomalously enhanced at temperatures as high as 150 K.},

It is found that the splitting of the occupiedspin-up bands and the corresponding unoccupied spin-down bands increases almost linearly with the increase of U, while the positions of the completely empty orbitals (both spin-up and -down bands are unoccupied) are not sensitive to the value of U. These features cause the gaps of the compounds to increase first with U, and then they can increase (LaFeO3), decrease (LaCrO3 and LaMnO3) or even drop to zero (LaCoO3). The local magnetic moments increase linearly with increasing U. After considering the on-site Coulomb interaction, the binding energies for the perovskites are lowered, and decrease with the increase of U. The exchange parameter J also influences the electronic properties, though not as strongly as that of the U. A group of values of U and J parameters, which can give results closer to that given by experiments, have been found.},

The ansatz shows good agreement with recent angle resolved photoemission on underdoped cuprates and resolves an apparent disagreement with the Luttinger sum rule. The transition in the normal state from a doped RVB spin liquid to a standard Landau Fermi liquid, that occurs in the renormalized mean field theory, appears as a quantum critical point characterized by a change in the analytic form of the Green's function. A d-wave superconducting dome surrounding this quantum critical point is introduced phenomenologically.

In particular, the modulated checkerboard structures are incapable of supporting the experimentally well-established resonance peak at ({$\pi$},{$\pi$}).},

With angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we have systematically studied the effects of chemical substitution on the electronic structure of various series of iron-based superconductors. Beyond the Fermi-surface alteration that has been reported most often in the past, we found two more extraordinary effects of doping: (1) the site and band dependencies of quasiparticle scattering and, more importantly, (2) the ubiquitous and significant change of electronic correlation by both isovalent and heterovalent dopants in the iron-anion layer. Moreover, we found that the electronic correlation could be suppressed by applying either the chemical pressure or doping electrons but not by doping holes. Together with other findings provided here, these results complete the microscopic picture of the electronic effects of dopants, which facilitates a unified understanding of the diversified phase diagrams and resolutions to many open issues of various iron-based superconductors.},

Many theoretical techniques have been applied to individual compounds but no consistent description of the microscopic origin of these variations is available. Here we carry out a comparative theoretical study of a large number of iron-based compounds in both their magnetic and paramagnetic states. Taking into account correlation effects and realistic band structures, we describe well the trends in all of the physical properties such as the ordered moments, effective masses and Fermi surfaces across all families of iron compounds, and find them to be in good agreement with experiments. We trace variation in physical properties to variations in the key structural parameters, rather than changes in the screening of the Coulomb interactions. Our results also provide a natural explanation of the strongly Fermi-surface-dependent superconducting gaps observed in experiments.},

Uncovering the character of the proximate magnetic phase is a crucial step towards understanding the mechanism of superconductivity. Unlike the case in the cuprate superconductors, the nature of the magnetism and its underlying electronic state in the iron pnictide superconductors is still not well understood. Many low-energy probes such as transport, scanning tunnelling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy have measured strong in-plane anisotropy of the electronic states, but there is no consensus on its physical origin. Using a first-principles theoretical approach, we modelled the magnetic state of the BaFe2As2 parent compound and obtained the magnetic moment, optical conductivity and anisotropy of the electronic states, all in excellent agreement with experiments. We demonstrate that energy-dependent spin and orbital polarizations are essential features of the magnetic state in iron pnictides. Although the spin polarization is enhanced at high energy, the orbital polarization is strong only at low energy. A gain of Hund's coupling energy rather than Hubbard repulsion energy compensates the loss in kinetic energy, thereby stabilizing the low-temperature magnetic phase.},

Analyzing the kinetic energy, we reveal that, for U{$>$}Uco, only doped holes (electrons) become charge carriers, which will make a small Fermi surface (hole pocket), but for U{$<$}Uco all the electrons (holes) contribute to conduction and will make an ordinary large Fermi surface, which is contradictory to the feature of cuprates. By introducing an appropriate negative (positive) t{${'}$}/tt'/t, the SC (AF) state is stabilized. In the underdoped regime, the strength of SC for U{$>$}Uco is determined by two factors, i.e., the AF spin correlation, which creates singlet pairs (pseudogap), and the charge mobility dominated by Mott physics. In this connection, we argue that the electrons near the antinodal points in the momentum space play a leading role in stabilizing the dd-wave state, in contrast to the dichotomy of electronic roles in the momentum space proposed for the two-gap problem. We also show the instability of the hole-doped AF state against phase separation.},

We investigate the relative stability of various phases of VO2 using different levels of energy functionals within density functional theory (DFT). It is found that straightforward applications of several popular energy functionals, including the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional, result in a wrong prediction for the ground state of VO2. In particular, although the HSE and DFT+U methods are able to produce a band gap in the M1 phase, they strongly favor the formation of local magnetic moments, a result that clearly disagrees with experiments. We also examine the effect of the occupation and the redistribution of the d derived t2g (i.e., dxz, dyz, and dx2-y2) orbitals of V atoms on the calculated relative phase stability of VO2. We find that a small change in d occupation can result in a drastically different theoretical prediction. With the introduction of an orbital-dependent potential, a complete separation between the dx2-y2 derived valence band and dxz and dyz derived conduction bands in the M1 phase is achieved, resulting in a slight redistribution of the d occupation and a more faithful account of the polarization of the t2g orbitals. This slight rearrangement of the d occupation also leads to a relative phase stability of VO2 (including structural and magnetic phases) that agrees well with experiment.},

  abstract = {Superconductivity in the iron pnictides and chalcogenides is closely connected to a bad-metal normal state and a nearby antiferromagnetic order. Therefore, considerable attention has been focused on the role of electron correlations and spin dynamics. In this article, we summarize some key experiments that quite directly imply strong electron correlations in these materials, and discuss aspects of the recent theoretical studies on these issues. In particular, we outline a w-expansion, which treats the correlation effects using the Mott transition as the reference point. For the parent systems, it gives rise to an effective J1-J2 model that is coupled to the itinerant electrons in the vicinity of the Fermi energy; this model yields an isoelectronically-tuned quantum critical point, and allows a study of the distribution of the spin spectral weight in the energy and momentum space in the paramagnetic phase. Within the same framework, we demonstrate the Mott insulating phase in the iron oxychalcogenides as well as the alkaline iron selenides; for the latter system, we also consider the role of an orbital-selective Mott phase. Finally, we discuss the singlet superconducting pairing driven by the short-range J1-J2 interactions. Our considerations highlight the iron pnictides and chalcogenides as exemplifying strongly-correlated electron systems at the boundary of electronic localization and itinerancy.},

The use of a direct-solution, many-body approach inherently secures a good description of electron-electron interactions, achieving high accuracy without adjustable parameters. According to FN-DMC nitrogen is a deep acceptor with a charge transition level 1.0(3) eV above the valence-band maximum when 72-atom supercells are used. This result falls on the lower end of typically reported hybrid density functional results for the same size supercells, which range from 1.0 to 1.8 eV. Further, residual finite-size effects due to charged defect image interactions in the 72-atom supercells are estimated by supercell extrapolation within hybrid density functional theory. When the finite-size correction is included, we obtain a deep acceptor at 1.6(3) eV. This result is in good agreement with recent experimental measurements. We also analyze the local compressibility of charge according to FN-DMC and common density functionals and find that the use of hybrid functionals obtains compressibilities in better agreement with the many-body theory. Our work illustrates the application of the FN-DMC method to a challenging point defect problem, demonstrating that uncertainties and approximations can be well controlled.},

  abstract = {In the two-dimensional Kondo\textemdash Heisenberg lattice model away from half-filled, the local antiferromagnetic exchange coupling can provide the pairing mechanism of quasiparticles via the Kondo screening effect, leading to the heavy fermion superconductivity. We find that the pairing symmetry strongly depends on the Fermi surface (FS) structure in the normal metallic state. When J H /J K is very small, the FS is a small hole-like circle around the corner of the Brillouin zone, and the s-wave pairing symmetry has a lower ground state energy. For the intermediate coupling values of J H /J K , the extended s-wave pairing symmetry gives the favored ground state. However, when J H /J K is larger than a critical value, the FS transforms into four small hole pockets crossing the boundary of the magnetic Brillouin zone, and the d-wave pairing symmetry becomes more favorable. In that regime, the resulting superconducting state is characterized by either a nodal d-wave or nodeless d-wave state, depending on the conduction electron filling factor as well. A continuous phase transition exists between these two states. This result may be related to the phase transition of the nodal d-wave state to a fully gapped state, which has recently been observed in Yb-doped CeCoIn 5 .},

This model is discussed in a more general framework of the electronic structure of transition-metal compounds as has emerged from detailed electron-spectroscopy studies. We argue that the Emery model corresponds with the charge-transfer semiconductor in this electronic picture. Using canonical perturbation theory we analyze systematically the near-ground-state physics when holes are introduced into such a system. We derive explicit expressions for the carrier-spin, spin-spin, and carrier-carrier interactions which turn out to depend in a nontrivial way on the electronic parameters, thereby creating a link between the high-energy data and the macroscopic physics in these systems. We find that the dominant interactions are the Kondo-like spin-carrier interactions which give rise to the well-known magnetic semiconductor physics characterized by ferromagnetic correlations (spin polarons, double exchange). Using some simple finite models we discuss then the pairing mechanisms as proposed by Emery and Hirsch. We show that both of them are based on fourth-order attractive interactions. These are, however, overruled by the second-order processes which favor the opposite behavior and suppress the pairing. Our conclusion is that the charge degrees of freedom are essential in the real high-temperature superconductors and we supply further evidence in favor of their mixed-valence behavior.},

Furthermore, by correlating the energies of measured zero phonon lines (ZPLs) with theoretical values derived from hybrid density functional theory each of the ZPLs has been associated to the respective occupation of hexagonal (h) and quasicubic (k) lattice sites in close analogy to neutral divacancy centers (VCVSi)0 in the same material. Finally, with the appropriate choice of excitation energy we demonstrated the selective excitation of (NCVSi)- PL with no contamination by (VCVSi)0 PL, thereby opening the way towards the optical detection of (NCVSi)- electron spin resonance.},

DMC with the fixed-node approximation relies on modifications of the Green's function to avoid singularities near the nodal surface of the trial wave function. Here we show that these modifications affect the DMC energies in a way that is not size consistent, resulting in large time-step errors. Building on the modifications of Umrigar et al. and DePasquale et al. we propose a simple Green's function modification that restores size consistency to large values of the time step, which substantially reduces time-step errors. This algorithm also yields remarkable speedups of up to two orders of magnitude in the calculation of molecule-molecule binding energies and crystal cohesive energies, thus extending the horizons of what is possible with DMC.},

Quantum Monte Carlo techniques are correlated electronic structure methods promising for large molecules, which are intrinsically affected by stochastic errors on both energy and force calculations, making the mentioned calculations more challenging with respect to other more traditional quantum chemistry tools. To circumvent this drawback in the present work, we formulate the general problem of evaluating the molecular equilibrium structures, the harmonic frequencies, and the anharmonic coefficients of an error affected potential energy surface. The proposed approach, based on a multidimensional fitting procedure, is illustrated together with a critical evaluation of systematic and statistical errors. We observe that the use of forces instead of energies in the fitting procedure reduces the statistical uncertainty of the vibrational parameters by 1 order of magnitude. Preliminary results based on variational Monte Carlo calculations on the water molecule demonstrate the possibility to evaluate geometrical parameters and harmonic and anharmonic coefficients at this level of theory with an affordable computational cost and a small stochastic uncertainty ({$<$}0.07\% for geometries and {$<$}0.7\% for vibrational properties).},

When the inversion symmetry is breaking but the the time-reversal symmetry is preserved, a second-order Hall effect called the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NLAHE) emerges owing to the nonzero Berry curvature on the nonequilibrium Fermi surface. We reveal a strong NLAHE with a Hall-voltage that is quadratic with respect to the longitudinal current. The optimal current direction is normal to the mirror plane in these two-dimensional (2D) materials. The NLAHE can be sensitively tuned by an out-of-plane electric field, which induces a transition from a topological insulator to a normal insulator. Crossing the critical transition point, the magnitude of the NLAHE increases, and its sign is reversed. Our work paves the way to discover exotic nonlinear phenomena in inversion-symmetry-breaking 2D materials.},

Among myriad approaches to addressing this problem has been the study of alternative transition metal oxides with similar structures and 3d electron count that are suggested as proxies for cuprate physics. None of these analogs has been superconducting, and few are even metallic. Here, we report that the low-valent, quasi-two-dimensional trilayer compound, Pr4Ni3O8 avoids a charge-stripe ordered phase previously reported for La4Ni3O8, leading to a metallic ground state. By combining x-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we further find that metallic Pr4Ni3O8 exhibits a low-spin configuration and significant orbital polarization of the unoccupied eg states with pronounced dx2-y2 character near the Fermi energy, both hallmarks of the cuprate superconductors. Belonging to a regime of 3d electron count found for hole-doped cuprates, Pr4Ni3O8 thus represents one of the closest analogies to cuprates yet reported and a singularly promising candidate for high-Tc superconductivity if appropriately doped.},

For La2CuO4 annealed in 0.6 bar oxygen, the N\'eel temperatures of the 16O and 18O samples are nearly equal due to segregation into oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor phases. For the other antiferromagnetic cuprates (which lack apical oxygen), we find a negligible oxygen isotope effect on TN. We suggest that the observed oxygen isotope effect on TN of La2CuO4 originates from the oxygen-mass dependences of J (in-plane antiferromagnetic exchange energy) due to the nonadiabatic motion of apical oxygen.},

  abstract = {Developing a theory of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides is one of the outstanding problems in physics. It is a challenge that has defeated theoretical physicists for more than 20 years. Attempts to understand this problem are hindered by the subtle interplay among a few mechanisms and the presence of several nearly degenerate and competing phases in these systems. Here, we present some crucial experiments that place essential constraints on the pairing mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. The observed unconventional oxygen-isotope effects in cuprates have clearly shown strong electron\textendash phonon interactions and the existence of polarons and/or bipolarons. Angle-resolved photoemission and tunneling spectra have provided direct evidence for strong coupling to multiple-phonon modes. In contrast, these spectra do not show strong coupling features expected for magnetic resonance modes. Angle-resolved photoemission spectra and the oxygen-isotope effect on the antiferromagnetic exchange energy J in undoped parent compounds consistently show that the polaron binding energy is about 2 eV, which is over one order of magnitude larger than J = 0.14 eV. The normal-state spin-susceptibility data of hole-doped cuprates indicate that intersite bipolarons are the dominant charge carriers in the underdoped region, while the component of Fermi-liquid-like polarons is dominant in the overdoped region. All the experiments for testing the gap or order-parameter symmetry consistently demonstrate that the intrinsic gap (pairing) symmetry for the Fermi-liquid-like component is anisotropic s-wave and the order-parameter symmetry of the Bose\textendash Einstein condensation of bipolarons is d-wave.},

  abstract = {Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a paradigmatic example of a strongly correlated system that undergoes a metal-insulator transition at a structural phase transition. To date, this transition has necessitated significant post hoc adjustments to theory in order to be described properly. Here we report standard state-of-the-art first principles quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the structural dependence of the properties of VO2. Using this technique, we simulate the interactions between electrons explicitly, which allows for the metal-insulator transition to naturally emerge, importantly without ad hoc adjustments. The QMC calculations show that the structural transition directly causes the metal-insulator transition and a change in the coupling of vanadium spins. This change in the spin coupling results in a prediction of a momentum-independent magnetic excitation in the insulating state. While two-body correlations are important to set the stage for this transition, they do not change significantly when VO2 becomes an insulator. These results show that it is now possible to account for electron correlations in a quantitatively accurate way that is also specific to materials.},

  abstract = {Electron correlation in graphene is unique because of the interplay between the Dirac cone dispersion of {$\pi$} electrons and long-range Coulomb interaction. Because of the zero density of states at Fermi level, the random phase approximation predicts no metallic screening at long distance and low energy, so one might expect that graphene should be a poorly screened system. However, empirically graphene is a weakly interacting semimetal, which leads to the question of how electron correlations take place in graphene at different length scales. We address this question by computing the equal time and dynamic structure factor S(q) and S(q,{$\omega$}) of freestanding graphene using ab initio fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo simulations and the random phase approximation. We find that the {$\sigma$} electrons contribute strongly to S(q,{$\omega$}) for relevant experimental values of {$\omega$} even at distances up to around 80 \AA. These findings illustrate how the emergent physics from underlying Coulomb interactions results in the observed weakly correlated semimetal.},

The authors present highly accurate quantum Monte Carlo calculations performed from first principles, which provide unprecedented detail into the microscopic electronic structure of VO\$\_2\$. The relative contribution of structural symmetry breaking and electron correlation are quantitatively evaluated. The structural distortion of the metal-insulator transition cooperates with the electron correlations to form a state of singlet dimers.

Although it appears simple, solving the HM when the interactions are repulsive, the particles are fermions, and the temperature is low\textemdash all of which applies in the case of correlated electron systems\textemdash is computationally challenging. Two groups have tackled this important problem. Huang et al. studied a three-band version of the HM at finite temperature, whereas Zheng et al. used five complementary numerical methods that kept each other in check to discern the ground state of the HM. Both groups found evidence for stripes, or one-dimensional charge and/or spin density modulations. Science, this issue p. 1161, p. 1155 Competing inhomogeneous orders are a central feature of correlated electron materials, including the high-temperature superconductors. The two-dimensional Hubbard model serves as the canonical microscopic physical model for such systems. Multiple orders have been proposed in the underdoped part of the phase diagram, which corresponds to a regime of maximum numerical difficulty. By combining the latest numerical methods in exhaustive simulations, we uncover the ordering in the underdoped ground state. We find a stripe order that has a highly compressible wavelength on an energy scale of a few kelvin, with wavelength fluctuations coupled to pairing order. The favored filled stripe order is different from that seen in real materials. Our results demonstrate the power of modern numerical methods to solve microscopic models, even in challenging settings. Multiple numerical methods are used to study the ground-state and finite-temperature solutions of the Hubbard model.

  abstract = {Fermi surface of heavy electron systems plays a fundamental role in understanding their variety of puzzling phenomena, for example, quantum criticality, strange metal behavior, unconventional superconductivity and even enigmatic phases with yet unknown order parameters. The spectroscopy measurement of typical heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn\$\_\{5\}\$ has demonstrated multi-Fermi surface structure, which has not been in detail studied theoretically in a model system like the Kondo-Heisenberg model. In this work, we make a step toward such an issue in terms of the well-established large-N mean-field theory. However, it is surprised that the self-consistent calculation cannot reproduced the fermionology of the experimental observation of the system due to the unfounded sign binding between the hopping of the conduction electrons and the mean-field valence bond order. It is found that the fermionology of the system can be well reproduced if one relaxes the binding and considers the mean-field bond operator as a free parameter. Given the fermionology, the calculated entropy and superfluid density are in qualitative agreement with the experimental results, which confirms our treatment of the mean-field theory. Our result supports a \$d\_\{x\^\{2\}-y\^\{2\}\}\$-wave pairing structure in heavy fermion material CeCoIn\$\_\{5\}\$. In addition, we have also provided the scanning tunneling microscopy(STM) spectra of the system, which is able to be tested by the present STM experiments.},

Previously it has been shown by density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method that a single doped hole is always self-localized due to the quantum destructive interference of the phase string signs hidden in the t-J ladders. Here we report a DMRG investigation of hole binding in the same model, where a novel pairing-glue scheme beyond the BCS realm is discovered. Specifically, we show that, in addition to spin pairing due to superexchange interaction, the strong frustration of the phase string signs on the kinetic energy gets effectively removed by pairing the charges, which results in strong binding of two holes. By contrast, if the phase string signs are ``switched off'' artificially, the pairing strength diminishes significantly even if the superexchange coupling remains the same. In the latter, unpaired holes behave like coherent quasiparticles with pairing drastically weakened, whose sole origin may be attributed to the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) pairing of spins. Such non-BCS pairing mechanism is therefore beyond the RVB picture and may shed important light on the high-Tc cuprate superconductors.},

  abstract = {All-electron ab initio calculations are used to study the microscopic origin of the charge density wave (CDW) in 1T-TiSe2. A purely electronic picture is ruled out as a possible scenario, indicating that the CDW transition in the present system is merely a structural phase transition. The CDW instability is the result of a symmetry lowering by electron correlations occurring with electron localization. Suppression of the CDW in pressurized and in Cu-intercalated 1T-TiSe2 is explained by a delocalization of the electrons, which weakens the correlations and counteracts the symmetry lowering.},

  abstract = {Recently, the domains of low-dimensional (low-D) materials and disordered materials have been brought together by the demonstration of several new low-D, disordered systems. The thermal transport properties of these systems are not well-understood. Using amorphous graphene and glassy diamond nanothreads as prototype systems, we establish how structural disorder affects vibrational energy transport in low-dimensional, but disordered, materials. Modal localization analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and a generalized model together demonstrate that the thermal transport properties of these materials exhibit both similarities and differences from disordered 3D materials. In analogy with 3D, the low-D disordered systems exhibit both propagating and diffusive vibrational modes. In contrast to 3D, however, the diffuson contribution to thermal transport in these low-D systems is shown to be negligible, which may be a result of inherent differences in the nature of random walks in lower dimensions. Despite the lack of diffusons, the suppression of thermal conductivity due to disorder in low-D systems is shown to be mild or comparable to 3D. The mild suppression originates from the presence of low-frequency vibrational modes that maintain a well-defined polarization and help preserve the thermal conductivity in the presence of disorder.},

  abstract = {Many of the properties of graphene are tied to its lattice structure, allowing for tuning of charge carrier dynamics through mechanical strain. The graphene electromechanical coupling yields very large pseudomagnetic fields for small strain fields, up to hundreds of Tesla, which offer new scientific opportunities unattainable with ordinary laboratory magnets. Significant challenges exist in investigation of pseudomagnetic fields, limited by the nonplanar graphene geometries in existing demonstrations and the lack of a viable approach to controlling the distribution and intensity of the pseudomagnetic field. Here we reveal a facile and effective mechanism to achieve programmable extreme pseudomagnetic fields with uniform distributions in a planar graphene sheet over a large area by a simple uniaxial stretch. We achieve this by patterning the planar graphene geometry and graphene-based heterostructures with a shape function to engineer a desired strain gradient. Our method is geometrical, opening up new fertile opportunities of strain engineering of electronic properties of 2D materials in general.},

  abstract = {The first-principles divide-and-conquer density-functional approach has been extended to solid-state systems. The method has the following features. (1) It divides a periodic solid-state system into equivalent primitive cells and further divides each cell into subsystems. The electron density of each subsystem is determined through the local representation of the one-electron Hamiltonian and used to form the total density per primitive cell. The method calculates the electronic structure of solids without involving the reciprocal space and its associated band structure. (2) It uses numerical atomic orbitals as basis functions with great variational flexibility. The Hamiltonian and other matrix elements are evaluated by numerical integration without any shape approximation to the effective one-electron potential. (3) This method, based on real space partition, can be applied to extended solid-state systems without translational symmetry, such as defects and surface chemisorption. As the first step, we have applied and tested the method to the electronic structure calculations of various crystalline solids: metallic lithium and copper, ionic sodium chloride, and covalent diamond and silicon. The self-consistently computed cohesive energies, structural properties, and density of states are in good agreement with those from the local-density approximation band-structure calculations and experimental results. \textcopyright{} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

In typical undergraduate and graduate courses the motivation and elegance of the method are often missing, unlike the treatments frequently enjoyed by Fourier transforms. We review and modify the presentation of Legendre transforms in a way that explicates the formal mathematics, resulting in manifestly symmetric equations, thereby clarifying the structure of the transform. We then discuss examples to motivate the transform as a way of choosing independent variables that are more easily controlled. We demonstrate how the Legendre transform arises naturally from statistical mechanics and show how the use of dimensionless thermodynamic potentials leads to more natural and symmetric relations.},

  abstract = {The basic physical parameters which govern the metal-insulator transition in vanadium dioxide are determined through a review of the properties of this material. The major importance of the Hubbard intra-atomic correlation energy in determining the insulating phase, which was already evidenced by studies of the magnetic properties of V1-xCrxO2 alloys, is further demonstrated from an analysis of their electrical properties. An analysis of the magnetic susceptibility of niobium-doped VO2 yields a picture for the current carrier in the low-temperature phase in which it is accompanied by a spin cloud (owing to Hund's-rule coupling), and has therefore an enhanced mass (m{$\simeq$}60m0). Semiconducting vanadium dioxide turns out to be a borderline case for a classical band-transport description; in the alloys at high doping levels, Anderson localization with hopping transport can take place. Whereas it is shown that the insulating phase cannot be described correctly without taking into account the Hubbard correlation energy, we find that the properties of the metallic phase are mainly determined by the band structure. Metallic VO2 is, in our view, similar to transition metals like Pt or Pd: electrons in a comparatively wide band screening out the interaction between the electrons in a narrow overlapping band. The magnetic susceptibility is described as exchange enhanced. The large density of states at the Fermi level yields a substantial contribution of the entropy of the metallic electrons to the latent heat. The crystalline distortion removes the band degeneracy so that the correlation energy becomes comparable with the band width and a metal-insulator transition takes place.},
