The synthesis of the high temperature superconductor LaH<sub>10</sub> requires pressures in excess of 100 GPa, wherein it adopts a face-centered cubic structure. Upon decompression, this structure undergoes a distortion which still supports superconductivity, but with a much lower critical temperature. Previous calculations have shown that quantum and anharmonic effects are necessary to stabilize the cubic structure, but have not resolved the low pressure distortion. Using large scale path-integral molecular dynamics enabled by a machine learned potential, we show that a rhombohedral distortion appears at sufficiently low pressures, even with quantum and anharmonic effects. We also highlight the importance of quantum zero point motion in stabilizing the cubic structure.
