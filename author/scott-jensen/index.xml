mechanics of disordered systems. Here we study Monte Carlo \emph{dynamics}, performing simulations of the growth of correlations following
a quench from infinite temperature to a temperature well below the spin-glass transition temperature $T_c$ for a
one-dimensional Ising spin glass model with diluted long-range interactions. In this model, the probability $P_{ij}$
that an edge ${i,j}$ has nonvanishing interaction falls as a power-law with chord distance, $P_{ij}\propto1/R_{ij}^{2\sigma}$,
and we study a range of values of $\sigma$ with $1/2&amp;lt;\sigma&amp;lt;1$. We consider a correlation function $C_{4}(r,t)$. A
dynamic correlation length that shows power-law growth with time $\xi(t)\propto t^{1/z}$ can be identified
in the data and, for large time $t$, $C_{4}(r,t)$ decays as a power law $r^{-\alpha_d}$ with distance $r$ when
$r\ll \xi(t)$. The calculation can be interpreted in terms of the {\em maturation}
metastate averaged Gibbs state, or MMAS, and the decay exponent $\alpha_d$ differentiates between a trivial MMAS
($\alpha_d=0$), as expected in the droplet picture of spin glasses, and a nontrivial MMAS ($\alpha_d\ne 0$), as in the
replica-symmetry-breaking (RSB) or
chaotic pairs pictures. We find nonzero $\alpha_d$ \emph{even} in the regime $\sigma &amp;gt;2/3$ which corresponds to
short-range systems below six dimensions. For $\sigma &amp;lt; 2/3$, the decay exponent $\alpha_d$ follows the RSB prediction
for the decay exponent $\alpha_s = 3 - 4 \sigma$ of the {\em static} metastate, consistent with a conjectured
statics-dynamics relation, while it approaches $\alpha_d=1-\sigma$ in the regime $2/3&amp;lt;\sigma&amp;lt;1$; however,
it deviates from both lines in the vicinity of $\sigma=2/3$.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
